chapter one missus rachel lynde is surprised missus rachel lynde lived just where the avonlea main road dipped down into a little hollow fringed with alders and ladies eardrops and traversed by a brook
that had its source away back in the woods of the old cuthbert place it was reputed to be an intricate headlong brook in its earlier course through those woods with dark secrets of pool and cascade but by the time it reached lynde's hollow it was a quiet well conducted little stream
for not even a brook could run past missus rachel lynde's door without due regard for decency and decorum it probably was conscious that missus rachel was sitting at her window keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed from brooks and children up
and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never rest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof there are plenty of people in avonlea and out of it who can attend closely to their neighbor's business by dint of neglecting their own
but missus rachel lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage their own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain she was a notable housewife her work was always done and well done she ran the sewing circle
helped run the sunday school and was the strongest prop of the church aid society and foreign missions auxiliary yet with all this missus rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen window knitting cotton warp quilts she had knitted sixteen of them
as avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices and keeping a sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up the steep red hill beyond
anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of missus rachel's all seeing eye she was sitting there one afternoon in early june the sun was coming in at the window warm and bright
the orchard on the slope below the house was in a bridal flush of pinky white bloom hummed over by a myriad of bees thomas lynde a meek little man whom avonlea people called rachel lynde's husband was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field beyond the barn
missus rachel knew that he ought because she had heard him tell peter morrison the evening before in william j blair's store over at carmody that he meant to sow his turnip seed the next afternoon
peter had asked him of course for matthew cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about anything in his whole life and yet here was matthew cuthbert at half past three on the afternoon of a busy day placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill
and his best suit of clothes which was plain proof that he was going out of avonlea and he had the buggy and the sorrel mare which betokened that he was going a considerable distance now where was matthew cuthbert going and why was he going there
had it been any other man in avonlea missus rachel deftly putting this and that together might have given a pretty good guess as to both questions but matthew so rarely went from home that it must be something pressing and unusual which was taking him
he was the shyest man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where he might have to talk matthew dressed up with a white collar and driving in a buggy was something that didn't happen often missus rachel ponder as she might could make nothing of it
and her afternoon's enjoyment was spoiled i'll just step over to green gables after tea and find out from marilla where he's gone and why the worthy woman finally concluded he doesn't generally go to town this time of year and he never visits
if he'd run out of turnip seed he wouldn't dress up and take the buggy to go for more
yet something must have happened since last night to start him off i'm clean puzzled that's what and i won't know a minute's peace of mind or conscience until i know what has taken matthew cuthbert out of avonlea today accordingly after tea missus rachel set out she had not far to go
the big rambling orchard embowered house where the cuthberts lived was a scant quarter of a mile up the road from lynde's hollow to be sure the long lane made it a good deal further matthew cuthbert's father as shy and silent as his son after him
had got as far away as he possibly could from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods when he founded his homestead green gables was built at the furthest edge of his cleared land and there it was to this day
barely visible from the main road along which all the other avonlea houses were so sociably situated missus rachel lynde did not call living in such a place living at all it's just staying that's what she said as she stepped along the deep rutted grassy lane
bordered with wild rose bushes it's no wonder matthew and marilla are both a little odd living away back here by themselves trees aren't much company though dear knows if they were there'd be enough of them i'd ruther look at people to be sure
they seem contented enough but then i suppose they're used to it a body can get used to anything even to being hanged as the irishman said with this missus rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of green gables very green and neat and precise was that yard
set about on one side with great patriarchal willows and the other with prim lombardies not a stray stick nor stone was to be seen for missus rachel would have seen it if there had been privately she was of the opinion that marilla cuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house
one could have eaten a meal off the ground without overbrimming the proverbial peck of dirt missus rachel rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in when bidden to do so the kitchen at green gables was a cheerful apartment
or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully clean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor its windows looked east and west through the west one looking out on the back yard came a flood of mellow june sunlight but the east one
whence you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry trees in the left orchard and nodding slender birches down in the hollow by the brook was greened over by a tangle of vines here sat marilla cuthbert when she sat at all always slightly distrustful of sunshine
and here she sat now knitting and the table behind her was laid for supper missus rachel before she had fairly closed the door
there were three plates laid so that marilla must be expecting some one home with matthew to tea but the dishes were everyday dishes and there was only crab apple preserves and one kind of cake so that the expected company could not be any particular company
yet what of matthew's white collar and the sorrel mare missus rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery about quiet unmysterious green gables good evening rachel marilla said briskly this is a real fine evening isn't it won't you sit down
how are all your folks something that for lack of any other name might be called friendship existed and always had existed between marilla cuthbert and missus rachel in spite of or perhaps because of their dissimilarity marilla was a tall
thin woman with angles and without curves her dark hair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it she looked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience which she was
but there was a saving something about her mouth which if it had been ever so slightly developed might have been considered indicative of a sense of humor we're all pretty well said missus rachel i was kind of afraid you weren't though when i saw matthew starting off today i thought maybe he was going to the doctor's
marilla's lips twitched understandingly she had expected missus rachel up she had known that the sight of matthew jaunting off so unaccountably would be too much for her neighbor's curiosity oh no i'm quite well although i had a bad headache yesterday she said
matthew went to bright river we're getting a little boy from an orphan asylum in nova scotia and he's coming on the train tonight if marilla had said that matthew had gone to bright river to meet a kangaroo from australia missus rachel could not have been more astonished
she was actually stricken dumb for five seconds it was unsupposable that marilla was making fun of her but missus rachel was almost forced to suppose it are you in earnest marilla she demanded when voice returned to her yes of course
said marilla as if getting boys from orphan asylums in nova scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well regulated avonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation missus rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt she thought in exclamation points
marilla and matthew cuthbert of all people adopting a boy from an orphan asylum well the world was certainly turning upside down she would be surprised at nothing after this nothing
what on earth put such a notion into your head she demanded disapprovingly this had been done without her advice being asked and must perforce be disapproved well we've been thinking about it for some time all winter in fact returned marilla
missus alexander spencer was up here one day before christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the asylum over in hopeton in the spring
so matthew and i have talked it over off and on ever since we thought we'd get a boy matthew is getting up in years you know he's sixty and he isn't so spry as he once was his heart troubles him a good deal and you know how desperate hard it's got to be to get hired help
there's never anybody to be had but those stupid half grown little french boys and as soon as you do get one broke into your ways and taught something he's up and off to the lobster canneries or the states at first matthew suggested getting a home boy but i said no flat to that
they may be all right i'm not saying they're not but no london street arabs for me i said give me a native born at least there'll be a risk no matter who we get but i'll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born canadian
so in the end we decided to ask missus spencer to pick us out one when she went over to get her little girl we heard last week she was going so we sent her word by richard spencer's folks at carmody to bring us a smart likely boy of about ten or eleven we decided that would be the best age
old enough to be of some use in doing chores right off and young enough to be trained up proper we mean to give him a good home and schooling we had a telegram from missus alexander spencer today the mail man brought it from the station saying they were coming on the five thirty train tonight
so matthew went to bright river to meet him missus spencer will drop him off there of course she goes on to white sands station herself missus rachel prided herself on always speaking her mind she proceeded to speak it now having adjusted her mental attitude to this amazing piece of news
well marilla i'll just tell you plain that i think you're doing a mighty foolish thing a risky thing that's what you don't know what you're getting you're bringing a strange child into your house and home and you don't know a single thing about him nor what his disposition is like nor what sort of parents he had
nor how he's likely to turn out why it was only last week i read in the paper how a man and his wife up west of the island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he set fire to the house at night set it on purpose marilla and nearly burnt them to a crisp in their beds
and i know another case where an adopted boy used to suck the eggs they couldn't break him of it if you had asked my advice in the matter which you didn't do marilla i'd have said for mercy's sake not to think of such a thing that's what
this job's comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm marilla she knitted steadily on i don't deny there's something in what you say rachel i've had some qualms myself but matthew was terrible set on it i could see that so i gave in
it's so seldom matthew sets his mind on anything that when he does i always feel it's my duty to give in and as for the risk there's risks in pretty near everything a body does in this world there's risks in people's having children of their own if it comes to that they don't always turn out well
and then nova scotia is right close to the island it isn't as if we were getting him from england or the states he can't be much different from ourselves well i hope it will turn out all right said missus rachel in a tone that plainly indicated her painful doubts
only don't say i didn't warn you if he burns green gables down or puts strychnine in the well i heard of a case over in new brunswick where an orphan asylum child did that and the whole family died in fearful agonies only it was a girl in that instance well we're not getting a girl said marilla
as if poisoning wells were a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case of a boy i'd never dream of taking a girl to bring up i wonder at missus alexander spencer for doing it but there she wouldn't shrink from adopting a whole orphan asylum if she took it into her head
missus rachel would have liked to stay until matthew came home with his imported orphan but reflecting that it would be a good two hours at least before his arrival she concluded to go up the road to robert bell's and tell the news it would certainly make a sensation second to none
and missus rachel dearly loved to make a sensation so she took herself away somewhat to marilla's relief for the latter felt her doubts and fears reviving under the influence of missus rachel's pessimism well of all things that ever were or will be ejaculated missus rachel when she was safely out in the lane
it does really seem as if i must be dreaming well i'm sorry for that poor young one and no mistake matthew and marilla don't know anything about children and they'll expect him to be wiser and steadier that his own grandfather
it seems uncanny to think of a child at green gables somehow there's never been one there for matthew and marilla were grown up when the new house was built if they ever were children which is hard to believe when one looks at them i wouldn't be in that orphan's shoes for anything
my but i pity him that's what so said missus rachel to the wild rose bushes out of the fulness of her heart
chapter two matthew cuthbert is surprised matthew cuthbert and the sorrel mare jogged comfortably over the eight miles to bright river it was a pretty road running along between snug farmsteads with now and again a bit of balsamy fir wood to drive through
or a hollow where wild plums hung out their filmy bloom the air was sweet with the breath of many apple orchards and the meadows sloped away in the distance to horizon mists of pearl and purple while the little birds sang as if it were the one day of summer in all the year
matthew enjoyed the drive after his own fashion except during the moments when he met women and had to nod to them for in prince edward island you are supposed to nod to all and sundry you meet on the road whether you know them or not matthew dreaded all women except marilla and missus rachel
he had an uncomfortable feeling that the mysterious creatures were secretly laughing at him he may have been quite right in thinking so for he was an odd looking personage with an ungainly figure and long iron gray hair that touched his stooping shoulders
and a full soft brown beard which he had worn ever since he was twenty in fact he had looked at twenty very much as he looked at sixty lacking a little of the grayness when he reached bright river there was no sign of any train
he thought he was too early so he tied his horse in the yard of the small bright river hotel and went over to the station house the long platform was almost deserted the only living creature in sight being a girl who was sitting on a pile of shingles at the extreme end
matthew barely noting that it was a girl sidled past her as quickly as possible without looking at her had he looked he could hardly have failed to notice the tense rigidity and expectation of her attitude and expression she was sitting there waiting for something or somebody
and since sitting and waiting was the only thing to do just then she sat and waited with all her might and main matthew encountered the stationmaster locking up the ticket office preparatory to going home for supper and asked him if the five thirty train would soon be along
the five thirty train has been in and gone half an hour ago answered that brisk official but there was a passenger dropped off for you a little girl she's sitting out there on the shingles i asked her to go into the ladies waiting room but she informed me gravely that she preferred to stay outside
she's a case i should say i'm not expecting a girl said matthew blankly it's a boy i've come for he should be here missus alexander spencer was to bring him over from nova scotia for me the stationmaster whistled
guess there's some mistake he said missus spencer came off the train with that girl and gave her into my charge said you and your sister were adopting her from an orphan asylum and that you would be along for her presently that's all i know about it and i haven't got any more orphans concealed hereabouts
i don't understand said matthew helplessly wishing that marilla was at hand to cope with the situation well you'd better question the girl said the station master carelessly i dare say she'll be able to explain she's got a tongue of her own that's certain
maybe they were out of boys of the brand you wanted he walked jauntily away being hungry and the unfortunate matthew was left to do that which was harder for him than bearding a lion in its den walk up to a girl a strange girl an orphan girl
and demand of her why she wasn't a boy matthew groaned in spirit as he turned about and shuffled gently down the platform towards her she had been watching him ever since he had passed her and she had her eyes on him now matthew was not looking at her
a child of about eleven garbed in a very short very tight very ugly dress of yellowish gray wincey she wore a faded brown sailor hat and beneath the hat extending down her back were two braids of very thick decidedly red hair
her face was small white and thin also much freckled her mouth was large and so were her eyes which looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others so far the ordinary observer an extraordinary observer
might have seen that the chin was very pointed and pronounced that the big eyes were full of spirit and vivacity that the mouth was sweet lipped and expressive that the forehead was broad and full in short our discerning extraordinary observer might have concluded
was so ludicrously afraid matthew however was spared the ordeal of speaking first for as soon as she concluded that he was coming to her she stood up grasping with one thin brown hand the handle of a shabby old fashioned carpet bag the other she held out to him
i suppose you are mister matthew cuthbert of green gables she said in a peculiarly clear sweet voice i'm very glad to see you i was beginning to be afraid you weren't coming for me
i had made up my mind that if you didn't come for me to night
i wouldn't be a bit afraid and it would be lovely to sleep in a wild cherry tree all white with bloom in the moonshine don't you think you could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls couldn't you
matthew had taken the scrawny little hand awkwardly in his then and there he decided what to do he could not tell this child with the glowing eyes that there had been a mistake he would take her home and let marilla do that she couldn't be left at bright river anyhow
no matter what mistake had been made so all questions and explanations might as well be deferred until he was safely back at green gables i'm sorry i was late he said shyly come along the horse is over in the yard give me your bag oh i can carry it the child responded cheerfully
it isn't heavy i've got all my worldly goods in it but it isn't heavy and if it isn't carried in just a certain way the handle pulls out so i'd better keep it because i know the exact knack of it it's an extremely old carpet bag oh i'm very glad you've come even if it would have been nice to sleep in a wild cherry tree
we've got to drive a long piece haven't we missus spencer said it was eight miles i'm glad because i love driving oh it seems so wonderful that i'm going to live with you and belong to you i've never belonged to anybody not really but the asylum was the worst i've only been in it four months but that was enough
it's worse than anything you could imagine missus spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like that
they were good you know the asylum people but there is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum only just in the other orphans it was pretty interesting to imagine things about them
who had been stolen away from her parents in her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess i used to lie awake at nights and imagine things like that because i didn't have time in the day i guess that's why i'm so thin i am dreadful thin ain't i there isn't a pick on my bones
i do love to imagine i'm nice and plump with dimples in my elbows with this matthew's companion stopped talking partly because she was out of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy not another word did she say until they had left the village and were driving down a steep little hill
the road part of which had been cut so deeply into the soft soil that the banks fringed with blooming wild cherry trees and slim white birches were several feet above their heads the child put out her hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that brushed against the side of the buggy
isn't that beautiful what did that tree leaning out from the bank all white and lacy make you think of she asked well now i dunno said matthew why a bride of course a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil
i've never seen one but i can imagine what she would look like i don't ever expect to be a bride myself i'm so homely nobody will ever want to marry me unless it might be a foreign missionary i suppose a foreign missionary mightn't be very particular
but i do hope that some day i shall have a white dress that is my highest ideal of earthly bliss i just love pretty clothes and i've never had a pretty dress in my life that i can remember but of course it's all the more to look forward to isn't it and then
i can imagine that i'm dressed gorgeously this morning when i left the asylum i felt so ashamed because i had to wear this horrid old wincey dress all the orphans had to wear them you know a merchant in hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of wincey to the asylum some people said it was because he couldn't sell it
but i'd rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart wouldn't you when we got on the train i felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me but i just went to work and imagined that i had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress because when you are imagining you might as well imagine something worth while
and a big hat all flowers and nodding plumes and a gold watch and kid gloves and boots i felt cheered up right away and i enjoyed my trip to the island with all my might i wasn't a bit sick coming over in the boat neither was missus spencer although she generally is
she said she hadn't time to get sick watching to see that i didn't fall overboard she said she never saw the beat of me for prowling about but if it kept her from being seasick it's a mercy i did prowl isn't it and i wanted to see everything that was to be seen on that boat because i didn't know whether i'd ever have another opportunity
oh there are a lot more cherry trees all in bloom this island is the bloomiest place i just love it already and i'm so glad i'm going to live here i've always heard that prince edward island was the prettiest place in the world
and i used to imagine i was living here but i never really expected i would it's delightful when your imaginations come true isn't it but those red roads are so funny when we got into the train at charlottetown and the red roads began to flash past i asked missus spencer what made them red
and she said she didn't know and for pity's sake not to ask her any more questions she said i must have asked her a thousand already i suppose i had too but how you going to find out about things if you don't ask questions and what does make the roads red well now i dunno said matthew
there'd be no scope for imagination then would there but am i talking too much people are always telling me i do would you rather i didn't talk if you say so i'll stop i can stop when i make up my mind to it although it's difficult matthew
was enjoying himself like most quiet folks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking themselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it but he had never expected to enjoy the society of a little girl women were bad enough in all conscience but little girls were worse
he detested the way they had of sidling past him timidly with sidewise glances as if they expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to say a word that was the avonlea type of well bred little girl but this freckled witch was very different
and although he found it rather difficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental processes
chapter ninety nine the law we have seen how quietly
the fact being that every one was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs we will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy and follow the baroness
who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her had gone to seek her usual adviser lucien debray the baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her of a guardianship which over a girl of eugenie's character
for in the tacit relations which maintain the bond of family union the mother to maintain her ascendancy over her daughter must never fail to be a model of wisdom and a type of perfection now
an expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her mother's amorous and pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary moreover
not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal under the paternal roof but because she had at once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of men
unfortunately in this world of ours each person views things through a certain medium and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as others and madame danglars therefore very much regretted that the marriage of eugenie had not taken place
not only because the match was good and likely to insure the happiness of her child but because it would also set her at liberty she ran therefore to debray who after having like the rest of paris witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it
had retired in haste to his club where he was chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of conversation for three fourths of that city known as the capital of the world at the precise time when madame danglars dressed in black and concealed in a long veil
was ascending the stairs leading to debray's apartments
debray was occupied in repelling the insinuations of a friend who tried to persuade him
still when he recollected the independent proud spirit of eugenie he positively rejected it as utterly impossible though the same thought again continually recurred and found a resting place in his heart tea play
and the conversation which had become interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs
awaited the return of debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed
with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman at twenty minutes of twelve madame danglars tired of waiting returned home women of a certain grade are like prosperous grisettes in one respect they seldom return home after twelve o'clock
the baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as eugenie used in leaving it she ran lightly up stairs and with an aching heart entered her apartment contiguous as we know to that of eugenie she was fearful of exciting any remark
and believed firmly in her daughter's innocence and fidelity to the paternal roof she listened at eugenie's door and hearing no sound tried to enter but the bolts were in place madame danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the terrible excitement of the evening
and had gone to bed and to sleep she called the maid and questioned her mademoiselle eugenie said the maid
after which they desired me to leave saying that they needed me no longer
madame danglars therefore went to bed without a shadow of suspicion and began to muse over the recent events in proportion as her memory became clearer the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light what she had taken for confusion was a tumult
who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son eugenie she said to herself is lost and so are we the affair as it will be reported will cover us with shame
for in a society such as ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound
and her glance was turned towards heaven
and out of a fault nay even a vice sometimes produces a blessing and then her thoughts cleaving through space like a bird in the air rested on cavalcanti this andrea was a wretch a robber an assassin
and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education if not a complete one
supported by an honorable name how could she extricate herself from this labyrinth to whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation debray to whom she had run with the first instinct of a woman towards the man she loves and who yet betrays her
debray could but give her advice she must apply to some one more powerful than he
but no on reflection the procureur was not a merciless man and it was not the magistrate slave to his duties but the friend the loyal friend who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption
it was not the executioner but the surgeon who wished to withdraw the honor of danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their son in law and since villefort the friend of danglars had acted in this way
no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with or had lent himself to any of andrea's intrigues
appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage but the inflexibility of the procureur should stop there she would see him the next day and if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate she would at least
obtain all the indulgence he could allow she would invoke the past recall old recollections she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty yet happy days
he had only to turn his eyes on one side and allow andrea to fly and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called contempt of court and after this reasoning she slept easily
at nine o'clock next morning she arose and without ringing for her maid or giving the least sign of her activity she dressed herself in the same simple style as on the previous night then running down stairs she left the hotel walked to the rue de provence
for the last month this wretched house had presented the gloomy appearance of a lazaretto infected with the plague some of the apartments were closed within and without the shutters were only opened to admit a minute's air showing the scared face of a footman
and the neighbors would say to each other in a low voice
madame danglars involuntarily shuddered at the desolate aspect of the mansion
three times did the bell ring with a dull heavy sound seeming to participate in the general sadness before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard
he saw a lady a fashionable elegantly dressed lady
first madame who are you who am i you know me well enough we no longer know any one madame
where do you come from oh this is too much madame these are my orders excuse me your name the baroness danglars you have seen me twenty times
possibly madame and now what do you want
madame this is precaution not impertinence
or without speaking to the procureur well i have business with the procureur is it pressing business you can imagine so since i have not even brought my carriage out yet but enough of this here is my card
take it to your master madame will await my return yes go the concierge closed the door leaving madame danglars in the street she had not long to wait
directly afterwards the door was opened wide enough to admit her and when she had passed through it was again shut without losing sight of her for an instant the concierge took a whistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court and blew it
you will excuse this poor fellow madame
in the court showing his merchandise was a tradesman who had been admitted with the same precautions the baroness ascended the steps she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own
preoccupied as madame danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of it
raising his head bowed down by grief looked up at her with so sad a smile that her complaints died upon her lips forgive my servants he said for a terror i cannot blame them for from being suspected they have become suspicious
you too then are unhappy she said yes madame replied the magistrate then you pity me sincerely madame and you understand what brings me here
you wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just happened yes sir a fearful misfortune you mean a mischance a mischance repeated the baroness alas madame
said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of manner i consider those alone misfortunes which are irreparable and do you suppose this will be forgotten everything will be forgotten madame said villefort
your daughter will be married to morrow if not to day in a week if not to morrow and i do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter madame danglars gazed on villefort stupefied to find him so almost insultingly calm
am i come to a friend she asked in a tone full of mournful dignity
said villefort whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance and truly this assurance carried him back to different events from those now occupying the baroness and him well then be more affectionate my dear villefort
said the baroness speak to me not as a magistrate but as a friend and when i am in bitter anguish of spirit do not tell me that i ought to be gay villefort bowed when i hear misfortunes named madame
he said i have within the last few months contracted the bad habit of thinking of my own and then i cannot help drawing up an egotistical parallel in my mind that is the reason that by the side of my misfortunes
but this annoys you let us change the subject you were saying madame i came to ask you my friend said the baroness what will be done with this impostor impostor
certainly madame you appear to extenuate some cases and exaggerate others impostor indeed
is nothing more nor less than an assassin sir i do not deny the justice of your correction
come forget him for a moment and instead of pursuing him let him go you are too late madame the orders are issued
i hope so if they should arrest him i know that sometimes prisoners afford means of escape will you leave him in prison the procureur shook his head at least keep him there till my daughter be married
impossible madame justice has its formalities what even for me said the baroness half jesting half in earnest for all even for myself among the rest
replied villefort ah exclaimed the baroness without expressing the ideas which the exclamation betrayed villefort looked at her with that piercing glance which reads the secrets of the heart
you refer to the terrible rumors spread abroad in the world that the deaths which have kept me in mourning for the last three months
have not happened by natural means i was not thinking of that replied madame danglars quickly yes you were thinking of it and with justice
you who pursue crime so vindictively answer now
the baroness became pale you were saying this were you not well i own it i will answer you
then resting both hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual there are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown
villefort here extended his hand toward a large crucifix placed opposite to his desk when they are discovered i swear to you by all i hold most sacred
now after the oath i have just taken and which i will keep madame dare you ask for mercy for that wretch but sir are you sure he is as guilty as they say listen
this is his description benedetto condemned at the age of sixteen for five years to the galleys for forgery he promised well as you see first a runaway then an assassin
and who is this wretch who can tell a vagabond a corsican has no one owned him no one his parents are unknown
but who was the man who brought him from lucca another rascal like himself perhaps his accomplice the baroness clasped her hands
for heaven's sake madame said villefort with a firmness of expression not altogether free from harshness for heaven's sake
what am i the law has the law any eyes to witness your grief
has the law a memory for all those soft recollections you endeavor to recall no madame
and when it commands it strikes you will tell me that i am a living being and not a code a man and not a volume look at me madame
have mankind treated me as a brother have they loved me have they spared me has any one shown the mercy towards me that you now ask at my hands no madame they struck me always struck me
woman siren that you are
well be it so let me blush for the faults you know and perhaps perhaps for even more than those but having sinned myself it may be more deeply than others
i never rest till i have torn the disguises from my fellow creatures and found out their weaknesses i have always found them and more i repeat it with joy with triumph i have always found some proof of human perversity or error
every criminal i condemn seems to me living evidence that i am not a hideous exception to the rest alas alas alas all the world is wicked let us therefore strike at wickedness
with a feverish rage which gave a ferocious eloquence to his words
this young man though a murderer is an orphan abandoned by everybody so much the worse or rather so much the better
but this is trampling on the weak sir the weakness of a murderer his dishonor reflects upon us
oh sir exclaimed the baroness you are without pity for others well then i tell you they will have no mercy on you be it so said villefort raising his arms to heaven at least
delay the trial till the next assizes
no madame said villefort instructions have been given
five days are more than i require
i sometimes lose all recollection of the past and then i experience the same sort of happiness i can imagine the dead feel still it is better than suffering but sir he has fled let him escape inaction is a pardonable offence
i tell you it is too late early this morning the telegraph was employed and at this very minute
a dragoon has brought this despatch from the minister of the interior
madame danglars trembled with fear villefort started with joy arrested he exclaimed he was taken at compiegne and all is over
pale and cold adieu sir she said adieu madame replied the king's attorney as in an almost joyful manner he conducted her to the door
chapter seventeen when wendy grew up i hope you want to know what became of the other boys they were waiting below to give wendy time to explain about them and when they had counted five hundred they went up
they went up by the stair because they thought this would make a better impression they stood in a row in front of missus darling with their hats off and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes they said nothing but their eyes asked her to have them
but they forgot about him of course missus darling said at once that she would have them but mister darling was curiously depressed and they saw that he considered six a rather large number i must say he said to wendy
that you don't do things by halves a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them the first twin was the proud one and he asked flushing do you think we should be too much of a handful sir because if so we can go away
father wendy cried shocked but still the cloud was on him he knew he was behaving unworthily but he could not help it we could lie doubled up said nibs i always cut their hair myself said wendy
george missus darling exclaimed pained to see her dear one showing himself in such an unfavourable light then he burst into tears and the truth came out he was as glad to have them as she was he said
but he thought they should have asked his consent as well as hers
i don't think he is a cypher tootles cried instantly do you think he is a cypher curly no i don't do you think he is a cypher slightly rather not twin what do you think
it turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher and he was absurdly gratified and said he would find space for them all in the drawing room if they fitted in we'll fit in sir they assured him then follow the leader he cried gaily
mind you i am not sure that we have a drawing room but we pretend we have and it's all the same hoop la he went off dancing through the house and they all cried hoop la and danced after him searching for the drawing room and i forget whether they found it
but at any rate they found corners and they all fitted in as for peter he saw wendy once again before he flew away he did not exactly come to the window but he brushed against it in passing so that she could open it if she liked and call to him
that is what she did hullo wendy good bye he said oh dear are you going away yes you don't feel peter she said falteringly
that you would like to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject no about me peter no missus darling came to the window
would you send me to school he inquired craftily yes and then to an office i suppose so
very soon i don't want to go to school and learn solemn things he told her passionately i don't want to be a man o wendy's mother if i was to wake up and feel there was a beard peter said wendy the comforter i should love you in a beard
and missus darling stretched out her arms to him but he repulsed her keep back lady
but where are you going to live with tink in the house we built for wendy the fairies are to put it high up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights how lovely cried wendy so longingly that missus darling tightened her grip i thought all the fairies were dead missus darling said
because you see when a new baby laughs for the first time a new fairy is born and as there are always new babies there are always new fairies they live in nests on the tops of trees and the mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls and the blue ones are just little sillies who are not sure what they are
i shall have tink tink can't go a twentieth part of the way round she reminded him a little tartly
tink called out from somewhere round the corner it doesn't matter peter said o peter you know it matters
may i mummy certainly not i have got you home again and i mean to keep you but he does so need a mother so do you my love oh all right peter said as if he had asked her from politeness merely
long in coming but this promise sent peter away quite gay again
i suppose it was because wendy knew this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones you won't forget me peter will you before spring cleaning time comes of course peter promised and then he flew away he took missus darling's kiss with him
the kiss that had been for no one else peter took quite easily funny but she seemed satisfied of course all the boys went to school
but it was too late now and soon they settled down to being as ordinary as you or me or jenkins minor
in time they could not even fly after their hats want of practice they called it but what it really meant was that they no longer believed michael believed longer than the other boys
though they jeered at him so he was with wendy when peter came for her at the end of the first year she flew away with peter in the frock she had woven from leaves and berries in the neverland and her one fear was that he might notice how short it had become but he never noticed he had so much to say about himself
she had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times but new adventures had crowded the old ones from his mind who is captain hook
when she spoke of the arch enemy don't you remember she asked amazed how you killed him and saved all our lives i forget them after i kill them he replied carelessly when she expressed a doubtful hope that tinker bell would be glad to see her he said
who is tinker bell o peter she said shocked but even when she explained he could not remember there are such a lot of them he said i expect she is no more i expect he was right for fairies don't live long
but they are so little that a short time seems a good while to them wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to peter
but he was exactly as fascinating as ever and they had a lovely spring cleaning in the little house on the tree tops next year he did not come for her she waited in a new frock because the old one simply would not meet but he never came
perhaps he is ill michael said you know he is never ill michael came close to her and whispered with a shiver perhaps there is no such person wendy and then wendy would have cried if michael had not been crying
peter came next spring cleaning and the strange thing was that he never knew he had missed a year that was the last time the girl wendy ever saw him for a little longer she tried for his sake not to have growing pains
and she felt she was untrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge but the years came and went without bringing the careless boy and when they met again wendy was a married woman and peter was no more to her
than a little dust in the box in which she had kept her toys wendy was grown up you need not be sorry for her she was one of the kind that likes to grow up in the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker than other girls
all the boys were grown up and done for by this time so it is scarcely worth while saying anything more about them you may see the twins and nibs and curly any day going to an office each carrying a little bag and an umbrella
you see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door that used to be tootles the bearded man who doesn't know any story to tell his children
and always had an odd inquiring look
when she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about peter pan she loved to hear of peter and wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place
who was no longer fond of stairs missus darling was now dead and forgotten there were only two beds in the nursery now jane's and her nurse's and there was no kennel for nana also had passed away
she died of old age and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except herself once a week jane's nurse had her evening off
and then it was wendy's part to put jane to bed that was the time for stories it was jane's invention to raise the sheet over her mother's head and her own thus making a tent
i don't think i see anything to night says wendy with a feeling that if nana were here she would object to further conversation yes you do says jane
that is a long time ago sweetheart says wendy ah me how time flies does it fly asks the artful child the way you flew when you were a little girl
why can't you fly now mother because i am grown up dearest when people grow up they forget the way why do they forget the way because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless
it is only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly what is gay and innocent and heartless
or perhaps wendy admits she does see something i do believe she says that it is this nursery i do believe it is says jane go on
they are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when peter flew in looking for his shadow
you have missed a bit interrupts jane who now knows the story better than her mother when you saw him sitting on the floor crying what did you say i sat up in bed and i said boy why are you crying
yes that was it says jane with a big breath and then he flew us all away to the neverland and the fairies and the pirates and the redskins and the mermaid's lagoon
yes which did you like best of all i think i liked the home under the ground best of all
what was the last thing peter ever said to you the last thing he ever said to me was just always be waiting for me and then some night you will hear me crowing yes but alas he forgot all about me
wendy said it with a smile she was as grown up as that what did his crow sound like jane asked one evening it was like this wendy said
trying to imitate peter's crow no it wasn't jane said gravely
jane said ah yes many girls hear it when they are sleeping but i was the only one who heard it awake lucky you said jane and then one night came the tragedy it was the spring of the year
wendy was sitting on the floor very close to the fire so as to see to darn for there was no other light in the nursery and while she sat darning she heard a crow then the window blew open as of old
he was exactly the same as ever and wendy saw at once that he still had all his first teeth he was a little boy and she was grown up she huddled by the fire not daring to move helpless and guilty
a big woman hullo wendy he said not noticing any difference for he was thinking chiefly of himself and in the dim light her white dress might have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first hullo peter
she replied faintly squeezing herself as small as possible something inside her was crying woman woman let go of me hullo where is john he asked suddenly missing the third bed
john is not here now she gasped is michael asleep he asked with a careless glance at jane
that is not michael she said quickly lest a judgment should fall on her peter looked hullo is it a new one yes boy or girl girl now surely he would understand but not a bit of it
peter she said faltering are you expecting me to fly away with you of course that is why i have come he added a little sternly have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time
she knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning times pass i can't come she said apologetically i have forgotten how to fly i'll soon teach you again o peter don't waste the fairy dust on me
what is it he cried shrinking
for almost the only time in his life that i know of peter was afraid don't turn up the light he cried she let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy she was not a little girl heart broken about him
she was a grown woman smiling at it all
then she turned up the light and peter saw he gave a cry of pain and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew back sharply what is it he cried again she had to tell him
i am old peter i am ever so much more than twenty i grew up long ago you promised not to i couldn't help it
no you're not yes and the little girl in the bed is my baby no she's not
of course he did not strike
and wendy did not know how to comfort him though she could have done it so easily once she was only a woman now and she ran out of the room to try to think peter continued to cry and soon his sobs woke jane
boy she said why are you crying peter rose and bowed to her and she bowed to him from the bed hullo he said hullo said jane my name is peter pan he told her
yes i know i came back for my mother he explained to take her to the neverland yes i know jane said i have been waiting for you when wendy returned diffidently she found peter sitting on the bed post crowing gloriously
while jane in her nighty was flying round the room in solemn ecstasy she is my mother peter explained and jane descended and stood by his side with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when they gazed at him
he does so need a mother jane said yes i know wendy admitted rather forlornly no one knows it so well as i good bye said peter to wendy and he rose in the air and the shameless jane rose with him
it was already her easiest way of moving about wendy rushed to the window no no she cried it is just for spring cleaning time jane said he wants me always to do his spring cleaning
if only i could go with you wendy sighed you see you can't fly said jane of course in the end wendy let them fly away together
our last glimpse of her shows her at the window
as you look at wendy you may see her hair becoming white and her figure little again for all this happened long ago
and every spring cleaning time except when he forgets peter comes for margaret and takes her to the neverland where she tells him stories about himself to which he listens eagerly when margaret grows up she will have a daughter who is to be peter's mother in turn
he took a resolve after this not to misinterpret her words even when miss stackpole appeared to strike the personal note most strongly he bethought himself that persons in her view were simple and homogeneous organisms
to deal with her in strict reciprocity he carried out his resolve with a great deal of tact and the young lady found in renewed contact with him no obstacle to the exercise of her genius for unshrinking enquiry
the general application of her confidence her situation at gardencourt therefore appreciated as we have seen her to be by isabel and full of appreciation herself of that free play of intelligence
she presently discovered in truth that this obligation was of the lightest and that missus touchett cared very little how miss stackpole behaved missus touchett had defined her to isabel
as both an adventuress and a bore adventuresses usually giving one more of a thrill she had expressed some surprise at her niece's having selected such a friend
yet had immediately added that she knew isabel's friends were her own affair and that she had never undertaken to like them all or to restrict the girl to those she liked
my dear you'd have a very small society missus touchett frankly admitted and i don't think i like any man or woman well enough to recommend them to you when it comes to recommending it's a serious affair
i don't like miss stackpole everything about her displeases me she talks so much too loud and looks at one as if one wanted to look at her which one doesn't
i'm sure she has lived all her life in a boarding house and i detest the manners and the liberties of such places if you ask me if i prefer my own manners which you doubtless think very bad i'll tell you that i prefer them immensely
and she detests me for detesting it
missus touchett was right in guessing that henrietta disapproved of her but she had not quite put her finger on the reason a day or two after miss stackpole's arrival
which excited a vein of counter argument on the part of the correspondent of the interviewer who in the exercise of her profession had acquainted herself in the western world with every form of caravansary
ralph with his experimental geniality suggested by way of healing the breach that the truth lay between the two extremes and that the establishments in question ought to be described as fair middling
this contribution to the discussion however miss stackpole rejected with scorn middling indeed if they were not the best in the world they were the worst but there was nothing middling about an american hotel
i like to be treated as an american lady poor american ladies cried missus touchett with a laugh they're the slaves of slaves they're the companions of freemen henrietta retorted
they're the companions of their servants the irish chambermaid and the negro waiter they share their work do you call the domestics in an american household slaves miss stackpole enquired
if that's the way you desire to treat them no wonder you don't like america if you've not good servants you're miserable missus touchett serenely said they're very bad in america but i've five perfect ones in florence
i don't see what you want with five henrietta couldn't help observing i don't think i should like to see five persons surrounding me in that menial position
should you like me better if i were your butler dear her husband asked i don't think i should you wouldn't at all have the tenue the companions of freemen i like that miss stackpole said ralph
it's a beautiful description when i said freemen i didn't mean you sir and this was the only reward that ralph got for his compliment miss stackpole was baffled
which she privately judged to be a mysterious survival of feudalism it was perhaps because her mind was oppressed with this image that she suffered some days to elapse before she took occasion to say to isabel
my dear friend i wonder if you're growing faithless faithless faithless to you henrietta no that would be a great pain but it's not that faithless to my country then
that i hope will never be when i wrote to you from liverpool i said i had something particular to tell you you've never asked me what it is is it because you've suspected suspected what
you don't ask that right as if you thought it important you're changed you're thinking of other things tell me what you mean and i'll think of that will you really think of it that's what i wish to be sure of
i've not much control of my thoughts but i'll do my best said isabel henrietta gazed at her in silence for a period which tried isabel's patience so that our heroine added at last
isabel responded you say that right i had a good deal of talk with him he has come after you did he tell you so no he told me nothing that's how i knew it said henrietta cleverly
he said very little about you but i spoke of you a good deal isabel waited at the mention of mister goodwood's name she had turned a little pale i'm very sorry you did that she observed at last
i could have talked a long time to such a listener he was so quiet so intense he drank it all in what did you say about me isabel asked i said you were on the whole the finest creature i know
while i talked i never saw an ugly man look so handsome he's very simple minded said isabel and he's not so ugly there's nothing so simplifying as a grand passion
it's not a grand passion i'm very sure it's not that you don't say that as if you were sure isabel gave rather a cold smile i shall say it better to mister goodwood himself
isabel offered no answer to this assertion which her companion made with an air of great confidence he'll find you changed the latter pursued you've been affected by your new surroundings very likely i'm affected by everything
by everything but mister goodwood miss stackpole exclaimed with a slightly harsh hilarity isabel failed even to smile back and in a moment she said did he ask you to speak to me not in so many words
but his eyes asked it and his handshake when he bade me good bye thank you for doing so and isabel turned away yes you're changed you've got new ideas over here her friend continued i hope so said isabel
one should get as many new ideas as possible yes but they shouldn't interfere with the old ones when the old ones have been the right ones isabel turned about again if you mean that i had any idea with regard to mister goodwood
but she faltered before her friend's implacable glitter my dear child you certainly encouraged him isabel made for the moment as if to deny this charge instead of which however she presently answered
it's very true i did encourage him and then she asked if her companion had learned from mister goodwood what he intended to do it was a concession to her curiosity for she disliked discussing the subject
and found henrietta wanting in delicacy i asked him and he said he meant to do nothing miss stackpole answered but i don't believe that he's not a man to do nothing he is a man of high bold action
and whatever he does will always be right i quite believe that henrietta might be wanting in delicacy but it touched the girl all the same to hear this declaration ah you do care for him her visitor rang out
whatever he does will always be right isabel repeated when a man's of that infallible mould what does it matter to him what one feels it may not matter to him but it matters to one's self ah
i hope he'll hate me then said isabel i believe you hope it about as much as i believe him capable of it to this observation our heroine made no return
she was absorbed in the alarm given her by henrietta's intimation that caspar goodwood would present himself at gardencourt she pretended to herself however that she thought the event impossible and later
she communicated her disbelief to her friend for the next forty eight hours nevertheless she stood prepared to hear the young man's name announced the feeling pressed upon her it made the air sultry
and after strolling about for some time in a manner at once listless and restless had seated herself on a garden bench within sight of the house beneath a spreading beech where in a white dress ornamented with black ribbons
she formed among the flickering shadows a graceful and harmonious image
as to whom the proposal of an ownership divided with her cousin had been applied as impartially as possible as impartially as bunchie's own somewhat fickle and inconstant sympathies would allow
but she was notified for the first time on this occasion of the finite character of bunchie's intellect hitherto she had been mainly struck with its extent
it seemed to her at last that she would do well to take a book formerly when heavy hearted she had been able with the help of some well chosen volume to transfer the seat of consciousness to the organ of pure reason
of late it was not to be denied literature had seemed a fading light and even after she had reminded herself that her uncle's library was provided with a complete set of those authors which no gentleman's collection should be without
she sat motionless and empty handed her eyes bent on the cool green turf of the lawn her meditations were presently interrupted by the arrival of a servant who handed her a letter the letter bore the london postmark
you will remember that when you gave me my dismissal at albany three months ago i did not accept it i protested against it you in fact appeared to accept my protest and to admit that i had the right on my side
i had come to see you with the hope that you would let me bring you over to my conviction my reasons for entertaining this hope had been of the best but you disappointed it i found you changed
arbitrary or capricious therefore it is that i believe you will let me see you again you told me that i'm not disagreeable to you and i believe it for i don't see why that should be i shall always think of you
i shall never think of any one else i came to england simply because you are here i couldn't stay at home after you had gone i hated the country because you were not in it if i like this country at present
it is only because it holds you i have been to england before but have never enjoyed it much may i not come and see you for half an hour this at present is the dearest wish of yours faithfully
caspar goodwood isabel read this missive with such deep attention that she had not perceived an approaching tread on the soft grass
had laid before her a pair of alternatives now of course you're completely your own mistress and are as free as the bird on the bough i don't mean you were not so before but you're at present on a different footing
property erects a kind of barrier you can do a great many things if you're rich which would be severely criticised if you were poor you can go and come you can travel alone you can have your own establishment
i mean of course if you'll take a companion some decayed gentlewoman with a darned cashmere and dyed hair who paints on velvet you don't think you'd like that of course you can do as you please
she'd keep people off very well i think
that it's a great deal better you should remain with me in spite of there being no obligation it's better for several reasons quite apart from your liking it i shouldn't think you'd like it but i recommend you to make the sacrifice
she had a great regard for what was usually deemed decent and a young gentlewoman without visible relations had always struck her as a flower without foliage
when she sat in her damp waterproof and sketched the opportunities that europe would offer to a young person of taste this however was in a great measure the girl's own fault she had got a glimpse of her aunt's experience
and her imagination constantly anticipated the judgements and emotions of a woman who had very little of the same faculty apart from this missus touchett had a great merit she was as honest as a pair of compasses
but was never over inquisitive as regards the territory of her neighbour isabel came at last to have a kind of undemonstrable pity for her there seemed something so dreary in the condition of a person whose nature had as it were
so little surface offered so limited a face to the accretions of human contact nothing tender nothing sympathetic had ever had a chance to fasten upon it
no wind sown blossom no familiar softening moss her offered her passive extent in other words was about that of a knife edge isabel had reason to believe none the less
she was learning to sacrifice consistency to considerations of that inferior order for which the excuse must be found in the particular case it was not to the credit of her absolute rectitude
that she should have gone the longest way round to florence in order to spend a few weeks with her invalid son
that when ralph wished to see her he was at liberty to remember that palazzo crescentini contained a large apartment known as the quarter of the signorino i want to ask you something
isabel said to this young man the day after her arrival at san remo something i've thought more than once of asking you by letter but that i've hesitated on the whole to write about face to face nevertheless
what does it matter my dear isabel whether i knew my father was very obstinate so said the girl you did know yes he told me we even talked it over a little
asked isabel abruptly why as a kind of compliment a compliment on what on your so beautifully existing he liked me too much she presently declared that's a way we all have
if i believed that i should be very unhappy fortunately i don't believe it i want to be treated with justice i want nothing but that very good but you must remember that justice to a lovely being
is after all a florid sort of sentiment i'm not a lovely being how can you say that at the very moment when i'm asking such odious questions i must seem to you delicate
you seem to me troubled said ralph i am troubled about what for a moment she answered nothing then she broke out do you think it good for me suddenly to be made so rich
henrietta doesn't oh hang henrietta said ralph coarsely if you ask me i'm delighted at it is that why your father did it for your amusement i differ with miss stackpole
ralph went on more gravely i think it very good for you to have means isabel looked at him with serious eyes i wonder whether you know what's good for me or whether you care if i know depend upon it i care
don't question your conscience so much it will get out of tune like a strummed piano keep it for great occasions don't try so much to form your character it's like trying to pull open a tight tender young rose
live as you like best and your character will take care of itself most things are good for you the exceptions are very rare and a comfortable income's not one of them ralph paused smiling
isabel had listened quickly you've too much power of thought above all too much conscience ralph added it's out of all reason the number of things you think wrong put back your watch diet your fever
it's never wrong to do that she had listened eagerly as i say and it was her nature to understand quickly i wonder if you appreciate what you say if you do you take a great responsibility you frighten me a little
but i think i'm right said ralph persisting in cheer all the same what you say is very true isabel pursued you could say nothing more true i'm absorbed in myself i look at life too much as a doctor's prescription
why indeed should we perpetually be thinking whether things are good for us as if we were patients lying in a hospital why should i be so afraid of not doing right as if it mattered to the world whether i do right or wrong
you're a capital person to advise said ralph you take the wind out of my sails she looked at him as if she had not heard him though she was following out the train of reflexion which he himself had kindled
a large fortune means freedom and i'm afraid of that it's such a fine thing and one should make such a good use of it if one shouldn't one would be ashamed and one must keep thinking it's a constant effort
i'm not sure it's not a greater happiness to be powerless for weak people i've no doubt it's a greater happiness for weak people the effort not to be contemptible must be great and how do you know i'm not weak isabel asked
the gate of admirations italy as yet imperfectly seen and felt stretched before her as a land of promise a land in which a love of the beautiful might be comforted by endless knowledge
whenever she strolled upon the shore with her cousin and she was the companion of his daily walk she looked across the sea with longing eyes to where she knew that genoa lay
she was glad to pause however on the edge of this larger adventure there was such a thrill even in the preliminary hovering it affected her moreover as a peaceful interlude as a hush of the drum and fife in a career which she had little warrant
as yet for regarding as agitated but which nevertheless she was constantly picturing to herself by the light of her hopes her fears her fancies her ambitions her predilections
madame merle had predicted to missus touchett that after their young friend had put her hand into her pocket half a dozen times she would be reconciled to the idea that it had been filled by a munificent uncle
grown used to feeling rich the consciousness in question found a proper place in rather a dense little group of ideas that she had about herself and often it was by no means the least agreeable
it took perpetually for granted a thousand good intentions she lost herself in a maze of visions the fine things to be done by a rich independent generous girl who took a large human view of occasions and obligations
were sublime in the mass her fortune therefore became to her mind a part of her better self it gave her importance gave her even to her own imagination a certain ideal beauty
which in spite of increasing distance were still sufficiently salient they were recognisable without difficulty
she could summon back her faith in case of need with an effort but the effort was often painful even when the reality had been pleasant the past was apt to look dead and its revival rather to show the
livid light of a judgement day the girl moreover was not prone to take for granted that she herself lived in the mind of others
she was capable of being wounded by the discovery that she had been forgotten but of all liberties the one she herself found sweetest was the liberty to forget she had not given her last shilling sentimentally speaking
either to caspar goodwood or to lord warburton and yet couldn't but feel them appreciably in debt to her she had of course reminded herself that she was to hear from mister goodwood again but this was not to be for another year and a half
and in that time a great many things might happen she had indeed failed to say to herself that her american suitor might find some other girl more comfortable to woo because though it was certain many other girls would prove so
she had not the smallest belief that this merit would attract him but she reflected that she herself might know the humiliation of change might really for that matter come to the end of the things that were not caspar
a clear and quiet harbour enclosed by a brave granite breakwater but that day could only come in its order and she couldn't wait for it with folded hands that lord warburton should continue to cherish her image
seemed to her more than a noble humility or an enlightened pride ought to wish to reckon with she had so definitely undertaken to preserve no record of what had passed between them that a corresponding effort on his own part
would be eminently just this was not as it may seem merely a theory tinged with sarcasm isabel candidly believed that his lordship would in the usual phrase get over his disappointment
he had been deeply affected this she believed and she was still capable of deriving pleasure from the belief but it was absurd that a man both so intelligent and so honourably dealt with
should cultivate a scar out of proportion to any wound englishmen liked moreover to be comfortable said isabel and there could be little comfort for lord warburton in the long run in brooding over a self sufficient american girl
who had been but a casual acquaintance she flattered herself that should she hear from one day to another that he had married some young woman of his own country who had done more to deserve him
she should receive the news without a pang even of surprise it would have proved that he believed she was firm which was what she wished to seem to him
before the sittings of the great assembly had come to an end a young statesman destined to play the leading part in the government of the dutch republic during two decades had already made his mark
his readiness and persuasiveness of speech his industry and his gifts at once of swift insight and orderly thoroughness
but the old sores remained open moreover the refusal of the states general to receive the parliamentary envoys the murder of doreslaer and the protection afforded to royalist refugees had been additional causes of resentment
but the english council had not felt strong enough to take action the death of the prince of orange
appeared at first to open out a prospect of friendlier relations between the two neighbouring republics in january sixteen fifty one the great assembly formally recognised the commonwealth
and determined to send back to his old post in london the veteran ambassador joachimi who had been recalled the english government on their part anticipated his return by despatching in march oliver saint john and walter strickland
and saint john and strickland greeted with loud cries of regicides and many abusive epithets remembering the fate of doreslaer were in fear of their lives
on april fourth a conference was opened between the envoys and six commissioners appointed by the states to consider the proposals of the english government for a more strict and intimate alliance and union between the two states the dutch quickly perceived
that what the english really wanted was nothing less than such a binding alliance or rather coalition as would practically merge the lesser state in the greater but the very idea of such a loss of the independence that they had only just won was to the netherlanders unthinkable
the negotiations came to a deadlock
foremost amongst them prince edward son of the queen of bohemia the parliament threatened to recall the envoys but consented that they should remain on the undertaking of the estates of holland to protect them from further attacks and to punish the offenders
new proposals were accordingly made for an offensive and defensive alliance without any suggestion of a union coupled with the condition that both states should bind themselves not to allow the presence within their boundaries of avowed enemies of the other in other words
the expulsion of the members and adherents of the house of stewart including the princess royal and the queen of bohemia with their children
even the estates of holland dared not consider such terms and the states general would have angrily rejected them after some further parleying therefore about fisheries and trade restrictions it was felt that no agreement could be reached
and saint john and strickland returned to england on july thirty first sixteen fifty one their failure created a very bad impression upon the parliament all the old complaints against the dutch were revived and
as they had refused the offer of friendship that had been made to them it was resolved that strong measures should be taken to obtain redress for past grievances and for the protection of english trade interests at the instance of saint john
the famous navigation act was passed by the parliament october ninth sixteen fifty one this act struck a mortal blow at the dutch carrying trade by forbidding the importation of foreign goods into english ports except in english bottoms or in those of the countries which had produced the goods
scarcely less injurious was the prohibition to aliens to fish in british waters and the withdrawal of the rights based on the magnus intercursus for the maintenance of which dutch statesmen had so long and strenuously fought
there was consternation in holland and the states general determined to send a special embassy to london
a man in whose ripe judgment they had confidence to the office of council pensionary
who having been given letters of marque to prey upon french commerce
the english government however met the dutch complaints by raking up the long list of grievances that had stirred up a bitter feeling of popular hatred against the united provinces in england and by demanding reparation
they further demanded that dutch commanders should acknowledge england's sovereignty by striking flag and sail and by firing a salute whenever any of their squadrons met english ships in the narrow seas it was these last two questions
the right of search and the striking of the flag that were to be the real causes of the outbreak of a war that was desired by neither of the two governments but popular feeling and the course of events was too strong for them the news of the seizure of their vessels
not merely by privateers but by an english squadron under ayscue in the west indies had caused intense indignation and alarm in holland and especially in amsterdam pressure was brought to bear on the states general and the admiralties
who in pursuance of economy had reduced the fleet to seventy five ships it was resolved therefore on february twenty second
the council of state on hearing of this began also to make ready for eventualities negotiations were still proceeding between the two countries when martin tromp the victor of the battle of the downs
now lieutenant admiral of holland was sent to sea with fifty ships and instructions to protect dutch merchantmen from interference and to see that the states suffered no affront nothing was actually said about the striking of the flag
it came suddenly through a misunderstanding the dutch admiral while cruising past dover met on may twenty ninth fifteen english ships under blake
tromp declared that he had given orders to strike the flag but that blake again fired before there was time to carry them out be this as it may the two fleets were soon engaged in a regular fight and the english being reinforced tromp withdrew at nightfall
to the french coast having lost two ships great was the anger aroused in england where the dutch were universally regarded as the aggressors in the netherlands where the peace party was strong many were disposed to blame tromp despite his protests
adrian pauw himself left hastily for london john de witt being appointed to act as his deputy during his absence pauw's strenuous efforts however to maintain peace were all in vain despite the strong leanings of cromwell towards a peaceful solution
but popular feeling on both sides was now aroused
if humiliating terms were submitted to stiffened their attitude the result was that the envoys left london on june thirtieth sixteen fifty two and war was declared the dutch statesmen who sought to avoid hostilities were right
all the advantages were on the side of their enemies the dutch merchant fleets covered the seas and the welfare of the land depended on commerce the english had little to lose commercially
was superior in almost all other respects the stuarts had devoted great attention to the fleet and would have done more but for lack of means charles much abused ship money was employed by him for the creation of the first english professional navy
it had been largely increased by the parliament after sixteen forty eight and its generals blake penn and ayscue had already acquired much valuable experience in their encounters with the royalist squadron under prince rupert
and in long cruises to the west indies for the purpose of forcing the english colonies to acknowledge parliamentary rule the crews therefore were well trained and the ships were larger stronger and better armed than those of the dutch
the position of england lying as it did athwart the routes by which the dutch merchant fleets must sail was a great advantage even more important was the advantage of having a central control
whereas in the netherlands there were five distinct boards of admiralty to some extent jealous of each other and now lacking the supreme direction of an admiral general the war began by a series of english successes and of dutch misfortunes
early in july sixteen fifty two blake at the head of sixty ships set sail for the north to intercept the dutch baltic commerce and to destroy their fishing fleet off the north of scotland
he left ayscue with a small squadron to guard the mouth of the thames tromp meanwhile had put to sea at the head of nearly a hundred ships ayscue succeeded in intercepting a fleet of dutch merchantmen near calais
all of them being captured or burnt while blake with the main force off the north coast of scotland destroyed the dutch fishing fleet and their convoy after these first blows against the enemy's commerce good fortune continued to attend the english
tromp was prevented from following blake by strong northerly winds he then turned upon ayscue whose small force he must have overwhelmed but for a sudden change to a southerly gale the dutch admiral now sailed northwards and july twenty fifth
found the english fleet off the shetlands a violent storm arose from the force of which blake was protected while the dutch vessels were scattered far and wide on the following day out of ninety nine ships tromp could only collect thirty five
and to meet and convoy back the home coming ships
ayscue had previously sailed up channel with forty men of war and five fireships for a similar purpose the two fleets met on august sixteenth and despite his inferiority of force de ruyter forced ayscue to withdraw into plymouth and was able to bring his convoy home to safety
the ill success of tromp though he was in no way to blame for it caused considerable alarm and discontent in holland his enemies of the states party in that province took advantage of it to suspend the gallant old seaman from his command he was an orangist
and as the orange partisans were everywhere clamorously active the admiral was suspect in his place cornelisz witte de with was appointed a capable sailor but disliked in the fleet as much as tromp was beloved de with effected a junction with de ruyter
and with joint forces they attacked blake on october eighth near the shoal known as the kentish knock the english fleet was considerably more powerful than the dutch and the desertion of de with by some twenty ships decided the issue the dutch had to return home with some loss
but they were deceived in thinking that the struggle in the channel was over for the winter the deserters at the kentish knock were punished
full of resentment though he was at the bad treatment he had received tromp was too good a patriot to refuse at the end of november the old admiral at the head of one hundred warships put to sea for the purpose of convoying some four hundred fifty merchantmen through the straits
stormy weather compelled him to send the convoy with an escort into shelter but he himself with sixty ships set out to seek the english fleet which lay in the downs after some manoeuvring the two fleets met on december tenth off dungeness
while many english prizes were captured this state of things was however not to last long towards the end of february sixteen fifty three blake put to sea with nearly eighty ships and on the twenty fifth off portland met tromp at the head of a force nearly equal to his own in number
and he had moreover been at sea without replenishment of stores ever since the fight at dungeness while the english had come straight from port the fight
had lasted for two whole days when tromp found that his powder had run out and that on the third day more than half his fleet were unable to continue the struggle but inspiring his subordinates de ruyter evertsen and floriszoon with his own indomitable courage
tromp succeeded by expert seamanship in holding off the enemy and conducting his convoy with small loss into safety
meanwhile both nations had been getting sick of the war the dutch were suffering terribly from the serious interference with their commerce and carrying trade and from the destruction of the important fisheries industry
while the english on their side were shut out from the baltic where the king of denmark as the ally of the united provinces had closed the sound and from the mediterranean where admiral van galen
destroyed a british squadron off leghorn march twenty third in both countries there was a peace party
and was averse to war in the dutch republic the states party especially in holland the chief sufferer by the war was anxious for a cessation of hostilities and it found its leader in the youthful john de witt
had been appointed council pensionary cromwell took pains to let the estates of holland know his favourable feelings towards them by sending over in february a private emissary
thus early did the new council pensionary initiate a form of diplomacy in which he was to prove himself an adept this first effort was not a success the parliament published the letter with the title humble supplication of the states of holland
he induced the states general by a bare majority four provinces to three to send a conciliatory letter the date of which april thirtieth sixteen fifty three coincided with cromwell's forcible dissolution of the rump parliament and the assumption by him
with the support of the army of dictatorial powers
and their insistence now on the full satisfaction of all the english demands made a continuation of hostilities inevitable tromp after successfully bringing in two large convoys of merchantmen encountered june twelfth
near the gabbard the english fleet under monk and deane each fleet numbered about one hundred sail but the dutch ships were inferior in size solidity and weight of metal for two days the fight was obstinately and fiercely contested
tromp was obliged to retreat having lost twenty ships he complained bitterly as did his vice admirals de ruyter and de with to the board of admiralty of the inferiority of the vessels of his fleet as compared with those of the adversary
the english now instituted a blockade of the dutch coast which had the effect of reducing to desperate straits a land whose welfare and prosperity depended wholly on commerce amsterdam was ruined in these circumstances direct negotiation was perforce attempted
four envoys were sent representing the three maritime provinces at first it seemed impossible that any common ground of agreement could be found cromwell was obsessed with the idea of a politico religious union between the two republics which would have meant the extinction of dutch independence
una respublica which nothing but sheer conquest and dire necessity would ever induce the dutch people to accept accordingly the war went on though the envoys did not leave london hoping still that some better terms might be offered
but in order to gain breathing space for the efforts of the negotiators one thing was essential the breaking of the blockade the admiralties made a supreme effort to refit and reinforce their fleet but it lay in two portions eighty five sail under tromp in the maas
monk with about one hundred ships lay between them to prevent their junction on august fourth tromp sailed out and after a rearguard action off katwijk out manoeuvred the english commander and joined de with he now turned and with superior numbers attacked monk off scheveningen
the old hero fell mortally wounded at the very beginning of what proved to be an unequal fight
the states though much perplexed to find a successor to martin tromp were so far from being discouraged that great energy was shown in reorganising the fleet
meanwhile negotiations had been slowly dragging on the accession of cromwell to supreme power in december sixteen fifty three with the title of lord protector
for the new ruler of england had always professed himself an opponent of the war which had shattered his fantastic dream of a union between the two republics many conferences took place but the protector's attitude and intentions were ambiguous and difficult to divine
at last cromwell formulated his proposals in twenty seven articles the demands were those of the victor and were severe all the old disputes were to be settled in favour of england an annual sum was to be paid for the right of fishing
compensation to be made for the massacre of amboina and the officials responsible for it punished the number of warships in english waters was to be limited the flag had to be struck when english ships were met and the right of search to be permitted these demands
article twelve stipulated that the prince of orange should not at any time hold any of the offices or dignities which had been held by his ancestors or be appointed to any military command
was perfectly aware that it would be useless to present such proposals to the states general not only would they indignantly reject them but he had not the slightest hope of getting any single province even holland to allow a foreign power to interfere with their internal affairs
and to bid them to treat with harsh ingratitude the infant heir of a family to which the dutch people owed so deep a debt there was nothing for it but to prepare for a vigorous resumption of the war strong efforts were therefore made at de witt's instigation
to increase the fleet and secure the active co operation of denmark and france both friendly to the states but cromwell really wanted peace and showed himself ready to yield on certain minor points but he continued to insist on the exclusion of the prince of orange
not till the dutch envoys had demanded their passports did the protector give way so far as to say he would be content to have the exclusion guaranteed by a secret article what followed forms one of the strangest chapters in the history of diplomacy
he was able to reach the private ear of cromwell and to enter into clandestine negotiations with him the council pensionary knew well the hopelessness of any attempt to get the assent of the states general to the proposed exclusion even in a secret article
of the state of public feeling on this point with the result that the protector gave the envoy to understand that he would be satisfied if the estates of holland alone would affirm a declaration that the prince should never be appointed stadholder or captain general whether this concession was offered by cromwell proprio motu
in any case the council pensionary being convinced of the necessity of peace resolved to secure it by playing a very deep and dangerous game not only must the whole affair be kept absolutely from the cognisance of the states general
but also de witt was fully aware that the assent of the estates of holland to the proposed exclusion article could only be obtained with the greatest difficulty he was to prove himself a very past master in the art of diplomatic chicanery and intrigue
the council pensionary first set to work to have the treaty from which the exclusion article had been cut out ratified rapidly by the states general
the estates adjourned for a recess on april twenty first sixteen fifty four on the following day he presented the treaty to the states general
and such was his persuasive skill that he accomplished the unprecedented feat of getting this dilatory body to accept the conditions of peace almost without discussion
the treaty ratified and signed was sent back to london only one article aroused opposition
the so called temperament clause but cromwell had insisted upon it by this article
or commander of military or naval forces
addressed to the estates of holland not at the moment in session
the cleverness and skill now shown by the council pensionary were truly extraordinary a summons was sent out to the estates to meet on april twenty eighth without any reason being assigned the members on assembly were sworn to secrecy
and then the official letter from london was read to them
to the act of exclusion came upon the estates like a thunder bolt the sudden demand caused something like consternation and the members asked to be allowed to consider the matter with their principals before taking so momentous a decision three days were granted
but as it was essential to prevent publicity it was settled that only the burgomasters should be consulted again under oath of secrecy at the meeting on may first
that the act should be placed in his hands within two days after the ratification of the treaty was peremptory and threatening unless he received the act he would consider the treaty as not binding upon him using all his powers of advocacy
de witt succeeded after an angry debate in securing a majority for the act five towns however obstinately refused their assent and claimed that it could not be passed without it but de witt had made up his mind to risk illegality
and overruled their protest the act was declared to have been passed and was on may fifth sent to van beverningh and nieuwpoort with instructions not to deliver it until circumstances compelled them to do so
but for some five weeks the existence of the act was unknown to the states general and during that period
early in june a bribe induced one of de witt's clerks to betray the secret to count william frederick the news soon spread and loud was the outcry of the orange partisans and of the two princesses who at once addressed a remonstrance to the states general
all the other provinces strongly protested against the action of the estates of holland and of the council pensionary de witt attempted to defend himself and the estates by vague statements avoiding the main issue but insisting that nothing illegal had been done his efforts were in vain
all the secret instructions they had received from holland and the act of exclusion meanwhile the estates of holland themselves frightened at the clamour which had been aroused began to show signs of defection
they went so far as to pass a vote of thanks to the envoys for not having delivered the act to cromwell de witt's position appeared hopeless
his efforts to prevent the resolution of the states general from taking immediate effect proving unavailing he put forward the suggestion that on account of its importance the despatch should be sent to the envoys in cipher
this was agreed to and on june seventh the document was duly forwarded to london by the council pensionary
informing them that the estates of holland assented to the request made by the states general and that they were to send back the secret correspondence and also the act if it were still undelivered the result answered to his expectations
while the clerk was laboriously deciphering the despatch the envoys read between the lines of de witt's letter and without a moment's delay went to whitehall and placed the act in cromwell's hands the states general had thus no alternative between acceptance of the fait accompli
and the risk of a renewal of the war no further action was taken and the protector professed himself satisfied with a guarantee of such doubtful validity it is impossible to withhold admiration from de witt's marvellous diplomatic dexterity
and from the skill and courage with which he achieved his end in the face of obstacles and difficulties that seemed insurmountable but for the course of double dealing and chicanery by which he triumphed the only defence that can be offered is that the council pensionary
really believed that peace was an absolute necessity for his country and that peace could only be maintained at the cost of the act of exclusion
there is however every reason to believe that de witt was prompted to take the risks he did by purely patriotic motives and not through spite against the house of orange
not merely by the orange partisans but by popular opinion generally in the united provinces

every promise of the soul has innumerable fulfilments each of its joys ripens into a new want nature uncontainable flowing forelooking
in the first sentiment of kindness anticipates already a benevolence which shall lose all particular regards in its general light the introduction to this felicity is in a private and tender relation of one to one which is the enchantment of human life
unites him to his race pledges him to the domestic and civic relations carries him with new sympathy into nature enhances the power of the senses opens the imagination adds to his character heroic and sacred attributes
establishes marriage and gives permanence to human society the natural association of the sentiment of love with the heyday of the blood seems to require that in order to portray it in vivid tints which every youth and maid should confess to be true to their throbbing experience
one must not be too old the delicious fancies of youth reject the least savor of a mature philosophy as chilling with age and pedantry their purple bloom
and therefore i know i incur the imputation of unnecessary hardness and stoicism from those who compose the court and parliament of love but from these formidable censors i shall appeal to my seniors
for it is to be considered that this passion of which we speak though it begin with the young yet forsakes not the old or rather suffers no one who is truly its servant to grow old
glows and enlarges until it warms and beams upon multitudes of men and women upon the universal heart of all and so lights up the whole world and all nature with its generous flames
only it is to be hoped that by patience and the muses aid we may attain to that inward view of the law which shall describe a truth ever young and beautiful so central that it shall commend itself to the eye at whatever angle beholden
and the first condition is that we must leave a too close and lingering adherence to facts and study the sentiment as it appeared in hope and not in history for each man sees his own life defaced and disfigured
which have given him sincerest instruction and nourishment he will shrink and moan alas i know not why but infinite compunctions embitter in mature life the remembrances of budding joy and cover every beloved name
dwell care and canker and fear with thought with the ideal is immortal hilarity the rose of joy round it all the muses sing but grief cleaves to names and persons and the partial interests of to day and yesterday
the strong bent of nature is seen in the proportion which this topic of personal relations usurps in the conversation of society what do we wish to know of any worthy person so much as how he has sped in the history of this sentiment
and what fastens attention in the intercourse of life like any passage betraying affection between two parties perhaps we never saw them before and never shall meet them again but we see them exchange a glance or betray a deep emotion and we are no longer strangers
it is the dawn of civility and grace in the coarse and rustic the rude village boy teases the girls about the school house door but to day he comes running into the entry and meets one fair child disposing her satchel
he holds her books to help her and instantly it seems to him as if she removed herself from him infinitely and was a sacred precinct among the throng of girls he runs rudely enough but one alone distances him
for persons are love's world and the coldest philosopher cannot recount the debt of the young soul wandering here in nature to the power of love without being tempted to unsay as treasonable to nature aught derogatory to the social instincts
yet the remembrance of these visions outlasts all other remembrances and is a wreath of flowers on the oldest brows but here is a strange fact it may seem to many men in revising their experience
that they have no fairer page in their life's book than the delicious memory of some passages wherein affection contrived to give a witchcraft surpassing the deep attraction of its own truth to a parcel of accidental and trivial circumstances
no man ever forgot the visitations of that power to his heart and brain which created all things anew which was the dawn in him of music poetry and art which made the face of nature radiant with purple light
the morning and the night varied enchantments when a single tone of one voice could make the heart bound and the most trivial circumstance associated with one form is put in the amber of memory
when no place is too solitary and none too silent for him who has richer company and sweeter conversation in his new thoughts than any old friends though best and purest can give him for the figures the motions
the words of the beloved object are not like other images written in water but as plutarch said enamelled in fire and make the study of midnight thou art not gone being gone where'er thou art
thy loving heart in the noon and the afternoon of life we still throb at the recollection of days when happiness was not happy enough but must be drugged with the relish of pain and fear for he touched the secret of the matter who said of love
all other pleasures are not worth its pains and when the day was not long enough but the night too must be consumed in keen recollections when the head boiled all night on the pillow with the generous deed it resolved on
the clouds have faces as he looks on them the trees of the forest the waving grass and the peeping flowers have grown intelligent and he almost fears to trust them with the secret which they seem to invite yet nature soothes and sympathizes
a midnight bell a passing groan these are the sounds we feed upon behold there in the wood the fine madman he is a palace of sweet sounds and sights he dilates he is twice a man
he walks with arms akimbo he soliloquizes he accosts the grass and the trees he feels the blood of the violet the clover and the lily in his veins and he talks with the brook that wets his foot
the heats that have opened his perceptions of natural beauty have made him love music and verse it is a fact often observed that men have written good verses under the inspiration of passion who cannot write well under any other circumstances
the like force has the passion over all his nature it expands the sentiment it makes the clown gentle and gives the coward heart
into the most pitiful and abject it will infuse a heart and courage to defy the world so only it have the countenance of the beloved object in giving him to another it still more gives him to himself
as you know and as i have given you proof i have the greatest admiration in the world for one whose work for humanity has won such universal recognition i hope that we shall both forget this unhappy morning and that you will give me an opportunity of rendering to you in person
the apologies which are due to you i feel that anything less will neither rehabilitate me in your esteem nor secure for me the remnants of my shattered self respect i am hoping you will dine with me next week and meet a most interesting man george gathercole
to disturb a relationship which i have always hoped would be mutually pleasant if you will allow gathercole who will be unconscious of the part he is playing to act as peacemaker between yourself and myself
i shall feel that his trip which has cost me a large sum of money will not have been wasted i am dear mister meredith yours very sincerely remington kara
kara folded the letter and inserted it in its envelope he rang a bell on his table and the girl who had so filled t x with a sense of awe came from an adjoining room you will see that this is delivered miss holland
a man against whom my favourite weapon would fail she looked at him with interest in her eyes what is your favourite weapon mister kara she asked fear he said
if he expected her to give him any encouragement to proceed he was disappointed probably he required no such encouragement for in the presence of his social inferiors he was somewhat monopolizing cut a man's flesh and it heals he said
whip a man and the memory of it passes frighten him fill him with a sense of foreboding and apprehension and let him believe that something dreadful is going to happen either to himself or to someone he loves better the latter
and you will hurt him beyond forgetfulness fear is a tyrant and a despot more terrible than the rack more potent than the stake fear is many eyed and sees horrors where normal vision only sees the ridiculous
is that your creed she asked quietly part of it miss holland he smiled she played idly with the letter she held in her hand balancing it on the edge of the desk her eyes downcast
what would justify the use of such an awful weapon she asked it is amply justified to secure an end he said blandly for example i want something i cannot obtain that something through the ordinary channel or by the employment of ordinary means
if i can buy it well and good if i can buy those who can use their influence to secure this thing for me so much the better if i can obtain it by any merit i possess i utilize that merit
providing always that i can secure my object in the time otherwise he shrugged his shoulders i see she said nodding her head quickly i suppose that is how blackmailers feel he frowned
that is a word i never use nor do i like to hear it employed he said blackmail suggests to me a vulgar attempt to obtain money
and according to your argument they are also justified it is a matter of plane he said airily viewed from my standpoint they are sordid criminals the sort of person that t x meets i presume in the course of his daily work
t x he went on somewhat oracularly is a man for whom i have a great deal of respect you will probably meet him again for he will find an opportunity of asking you a few questions about myself i need hardly tell you
he lifted his shoulders with a deprecating smile i shall certainly not discuss your business with any person said the girl coldly i am paying you three pounds a week i think he said
i intend increasing that to five pounds because you suit me most admirably thank you said the girl quietly but i am already being paid quite sufficient she left him a little astonished and not a little ruffled
to refuse the favours of remington kara was by him regarded as something of an affront
he rang the bell this time for his valet fisher he said i am expecting a visit from a gentleman named gathercole a one armed gentleman whom you must look after if he comes
detain him on some pretext or other because he is rather difficult to get hold of and i want to see him
he will probably be interested if you take him into the library very good sir said the urbane fisher will you change before you go out kara shook his head i think i will go as i am he said get me my fur coat this beastly cold kills me
he shivered as he glanced into the bleak street keep my fire going put all my private letters in my bedroom and see that miss holland has her lunch fisher followed him to his car wrapped the fur rug about his legs
closed the door carefully and returned to the house
that he should return to kara's study and set the papers in order was natural and proper that he should conduct a rapid examination of all the drawers in kara's desk might be excused on the score of diligence since he was to some extent in the confidence of his employer
kara was given to making friends of his servants up to a point in his more generous moments he would address his bodyguard as fred and on more occasions than one and for no apparent reason had tipped his servant over and above his salary
mister fred fisher found little to reward him for his search until he came upon kara's cheque book which told him that on the previous day the greek had drawn six thousand pounds in cash from the bank
this interested him mightily and he replaced the cheque book with the tightened lips and the fixed gaze of a man who was thinking rapidly he paid a visit to the library where the secretary was engaged in making copies of kara's correspondence
answering letters appealing for charitable donations and in the hack words which fall to the secretaries of the great he replenished the fire asked deferentially for any instructions and returned again to his quest
this time he made the bedroom the scene of his investigations the safe he did not attempt to touch but there was a small bureau in which kara would have placed his private correspondence of the morning this however yielded no result
rum cove said fisher he paused for a moment before the closed door of the room and smilingly surveyed the great steel latch which spanned the door and fitted into an iron socket securely screwed to the framework he lifted it gingerly
there was a little knob for the purpose and let it fall gently into the socket which had been made to receive it on the door itself rum cove he said again and lifting the latch to the hook which held it up left the room closing the door softly behind him
he walked down the corridor with a meditative frown and began to descend the stairs to the hall he was less than half way down when the one maid of kara's household came up to meet him there's a gentleman who wants to see mister kara she said here is his card
fisher took the card from the salver and read mister george gathercole junior travellers club i'll see this gentleman he said with a sudden brisk interest he found the visitor standing in the hall
he was a man who would have attracted attention if only from the somewhat eccentric nature of his dress and his unkempt appearance he was dressed in a well worn overcoat of a somewhat pronounced check he had a top hat glossy and obviously new at the back of his head
a pair of pince nez sat crookedly on his nose and two fat volumes under his arm completed the picture fisher who was an observer of some discernment noticed under the overcoat a creased blue suit large black boots
and a pair of pearl studs the newcomer glared round at the valet take these he ordered peremptorily pointing to the books under his arm fisher hastened to obey and noted with some wonder that the visitor did not attempt to assist him
either by loosening his hold of the volumes or raising his hand accidentally the valet's hand pressed against the other's sleeve and he received a shock for the forearm was clearly an artificial one it was against a wooden surface beneath the sleeve that his knuckles struck
and this view of the stranger's infirmity was confirmed when the other reached round with his right hand took hold of the gloved left hand and thrust it into the pocket of his overcoat where is kara growled the stranger
he told me he would be in at six o'clock at the latest six o'clock ye gods stormed the man impatiently what dog am i that i should wait till six
six o'clock eh you will tell mister kara that i called give me those books but i assure you sir stammered fisher give me those books roared the other
deftly he lifted his left hand from the pocket crooked the elbow by some quick manipulation and thrust the books which the valet most reluctantly handed to him back to the place from whence he had taken them tell mister kara i will call at my own time
good morning to you if you would only wait sir pleaded the agonized fisher wait be hanged snarled the other i've waited three years i tell you tell mister kara to expect me when he sees me he went out and most unnecessarily banged the door behind him
fisher went back to the library the girl was sealing up some letters as he entered and looked up i am afraid miss holland i've got myself into very serious trouble what is that fisher asked the girl
mister gathercole said the girl quickly fisher nodded yes miss i couldn't get him to stay though she pursed her lips thoughtfully mister kara will be very cross but i don't see how you can help it i wish you had called me
at six o'clock miss the man replied there is rather an important letter here which has to be delivered shall i ring up for a messenger no i don't think that would be advisable you had better take it yourself
she handed him the letter and he read without a droop of eyelid the superscription
special service department scotland yard whitehall he put it carefully in his pocket and went from the room to change large as the house was kara did not employ a regular staff of servants a maid and a valet comprised the whole of the indoor staff
the only other person in the house beside the girl was the middle aged domestic who was parlour maid serving maid and housekeeper in one miss holland sat at her desk to all appearance reading over the letters she had typed that afternoon
but her mind was very far from the correspondence before her she heard the soft thud of the front door closing and rising she crossed the room rapidly and looked down through the window to the street she watched fisher until he was out of sight
the maid who was also cook arose up as the girl entered it's a sight for sore eyes to see you in my kitchen miss she smiled i'm afraid you're rather lonely missus beale said the girl sympathetically lonely miss cried the maid
i fairly get the creeps sitting here hour after hour it's that door that gives me the hump she pointed to the far end of the kitchen to a soiled looking door of unpainted wood that's mister kara's wine cellar nobody's been in it but him
i know he goes in sometimes because i tried a dodge that my brother who's a policeman taught me i stretched a bit of white cotton across it an it was broke the next morning mister kara keeps some of his private papers in there said the girl quietly he has told me so himself
said the woman doubtfully i wish he'd brick it up the same as he has the lower cellar i get the horrors sittin here at night expectin the door to open an the ghost of the mad lord to come out him that was killed in africa miss holland laughed i want you to go out now she said
the girl ascended to the upper floor again she watched from the window the disappearing figure once out of sight miss holland went to work with a remarkable deliberation and thoroughness from her bag she produced a small purse and opened it
in that case was a new steel key
in two seconds it was open and she was examining its contents it was a large safe of the usual type there were four steel drawers fitted at the back and at the bottom of the strong box
an examination of the first drawer did not produce all that she had expected she returned the papers to the drawer pushed it to and locked it she gave her attention to the second drawer her hand shook a little as she pulled it open
it was a square case covered in red morocco leather she inserted her shaking hand and took it out with a triumphant little cry at last she said aloud and then a hand grasped her wrist and in a panic she turned to meet the smiling face
chapter twelve kara lay back on his down pillows with a sneer on his face and his brain very busy what started the train of thought he did not know but at that moment his mind was very far away
it carried him back a dozen years to a dirty little peasant's cabin on the hillside outside durazzo to the livid face of a young albanian chief who had lost at kara's whim all that life held for a man
to the hateful eyes of the girl's father who stood with folded arms glaring down at the bound and manacled figure on the floor to the smoke stained rafters of this peasant cottage and the dancing shadows on the roof
to that terrible hour of waiting when he sat bound to a post with a candle flickering and spluttering lower and lower to the little heap of gunpowder that would start the trail toward the clumsy infernal machine under his chair
he remembered the day well because it was candlemas day and this was the anniversary he remembered other things more pleasant
he remembered with a savage joy the spectacle of his would be assassins twitching and struggling on the gallows at pezara and
had t x returned he slipped from the bed and went to the door opened it slightly and listened t x with a search warrant might be a source of panic especially if he shrugged his shoulders he had satisfied t x and allayed his suspicions
kara breathed a sigh of relief and his face was wreathed in smiles why of course tell him to come up ask him if he minds seeing me in my room i told him you were in bed sir and he used shocking language said fisher kara laughed send him up he said
yes sir said the servant such an instruction was remarkably pleasing to him there was much that he had to do and that night's freedom would assist him materially perhaps kara hesitated perhaps you had better wait until eleven o'clock
bring me up some sandwiches and a large glass of milk or better still place them on a plate in the hall very good sir said the man and withdrew down below that grotesque figure with his shiny hat and his ragged beard was walking up and down the tesselated hallway
muttering to himself and staring at the various objects in the hall with a certain amused antagonism mister kara will see you sir said fisher oh said the other glaring at the unoffending fisher that's very good of him
yes sir said fisher look here the man thrust out his face do you see those grey hairs in my beard the embarrassed fisher grinned is it grey challenged the visitor with a roar
yes sir said the valet hastily is it real grey insisted the visitor pull one out and see the startled fisher drew back with an apologetic smile i couldn't think of doing a thing like that sir oh you couldn't sneered the visitor
then lead on fisher showed the way up the stairs this time the traveller carried no books his left arm hung limply by his side and fisher privately gathered that the hand had got loose from the detaining pocket without its owner being aware of the fact
he pushed open the door and announced mister gathercole and kara came forward with a smile to meet his agent who with top hat still on the top of his head and his overcoat dangling about his heels must have made a remarkable picture
fisher closed the door behind them and returned to his duties in the hall below ten minutes later he heard the door opened and the booming voice of the stranger came down to him fisher went up the stairs to meet him and found him addressing the occupant of the room in his own eccentric fashion
no more patagonia he roared no more tierra del fuego he paused certainly he replied to some question but not patagonia he paused again
and fisher standing at the foot of the stairs wondered what had occurred to make the visitor so genial i suppose your cheque will be honoured all right asked the visitor sardonically and then burst into a little chuckle of laughter as he carefully closed the door
damn all greeks he said jovially and fisher could do no more than smile reproachfully the smile being his very own the reproach being on behalf of the master who paid him the traveller touched the other on the chest with his right hand never trust a greek he said
always get your money in advance is that clear to you yes sir said fisher but i think you will always find that mister kara is always most generous about money don't you believe it don't you believe it my poor man said the other you
at that moment there came from kara's room a faint clang what's that asked the visitor a little startled mister kara's put down his steel latch said fisher with a smile which means that he is not to be disturbed until he looked at his watch
until eleven o'clock at any rate he's a funk snapped the other a beastly funk he stamped down the stairs as though testing the weight of every tread opened the front door without assistance slammed it behind him and disappeared into the night
as if the young lady had been in a position to appeal to it but in fact the british public remained for the present profoundly indifferent to miss isabel archer whose fortune had dropped her as her cousin said into the dullest house in england
her gouty uncle received very little company and missus touchett not having cultivated relations with her husband's neighbours was not warranted in expecting visits from them she had however a peculiar taste she liked to receive cards
for what is usually called social intercourse she had very little relish but nothing pleased her more than to find her hall table whitened with oblong morsels of symbolic pasteboard she flattered herself that she was a very just woman
and had mastered the sovereign truth that nothing in this world is got for nothing she had played no social part as mistress of gardencourt and it was not to be supposed that in the surrounding country a minute account should be kept of her comings and goings
but it is by no means certain that she did not feel it to be wrong that so little notice was taken of them and that her failure really very gratuitous to make herself important in the neighbourhood had not much to do with the acrimony of her allusions to her husband's adopted country
isabel presently found herself in the singular situation of defending the british constitution against her aunt
isabel always felt an impulse to pull out the pins not that she imagined they inflicted any damage on the tough old parchment but because it seemed to her her aunt might make better use of her sharpness
she was very critical herself it was incidental to her age her sex and her nationality but she was very sentimental as well and there was something in missus touchett's dryness that set her own moral fountains flowing now what's your point of view
she asked of her aunt when you criticise everything here you should have a point of view yours doesn't seem to be american you thought everything over there so disagreeable when i criticise i have mine it's thoroughly american
there are as many points of view in the world as there are people of sense to take them you may say that doesn't make them very numerous american never in the world that's shockingly narrow my point of view thank god is personal
isabel thought this a better answer than she admitted it was a tolerable description of her own manner of judging but it would not have sounded well for her to say so
would savour of immodesty even of arrogance
with whom she talked a great deal and with whom her conversation was of a sort that gave a large licence to extravagance her cousin used as the phrase is to chaff her
he very soon established with her a reputation for treating everything as a joke and he was not a man to neglect the privileges such a reputation conferred
of laughing at all things beginning with himself such slender faculty of reverence as he possessed centred wholly upon his father for the rest he exercised his wit indifferently upon his father's son this gentleman's weak lungs
his useless life his fantastic mother
his adopted and his native country his charming new found cousin i keep a band of music in my ante room he said once to her it has orders to play without stopping it renders me two excellent services
it keeps the sounds of the world from reaching the private apartments and it makes the world think that dancing's going on within
the liveliest waltzes seemed to float upon the air isabel often found herself irritated by this perpetual fiddling
and enter the private apartments it mattered little that he had assured her they were a very dismal place she would have been glad to undertake to sweep them and set them in order it was but half hospitality to let her remain outside
it must be said that her wit was exercised to a large extent in self defence for her cousin amused himself with calling her columbia and accusing her of a patriotism so heated that it scorched he drew a caricature of her
in the folds of the national banner isabel's chief dread in life at this period of her development was that she should appear narrow minded what she feared next afterwards was that she should really be so but she nevertheless
she would be as american as it pleased him to regard her and if he chose to laugh at her she would give him plenty of occupation she defended england against his mother but when ralph sang its praises on purpose as she said to work her up
she found herself able to differ from him on a variety of points in fact the quality of this small ripe country seemed as sweet to her as the taste of an october pear
and her satisfaction was at the root of the good spirits which enabled her to take her cousin's chaff
if her good humour flagged at moments it was not because she thought herself ill used but because she suddenly felt sorry for ralph it seemed to her he was talking as a blind and had little heart in what he said
i don't know what's the matter with you she observed to him once but i suspect you're a great humbug that's your privilege ralph answered who had not been used to being so crudely addressed i don't know what you care for
i don't think you care for anything you don't really care for england when you praise it you don't care for america even when you pretend to abuse it i care for nothing but you dear cousin said ralph if i could believe
even that i should be very glad ah well i should hope so the young man exclaimed isabel might have believed it and not have been far from the truth he thought a great deal about her she was constantly present to his mind
at a time when his thoughts had been a good deal of a burden to him her sudden arrival which promised nothing and was an open handed gift of fate had refreshed and quickened them given them wings and something to fly for
poor ralph had been for many weeks steeped in melancholy his outlook habitually sombre lay under the shadow of a deeper cloud
the old man had been gravely ill in the spring and the doctors had whispered to ralph that another attack would be less easy to deal with just now he appeared disburdened of pain but ralph could not rid himself of a suspicion that this was a subterfuge of the enemy
who was waiting to take him off his guard if the manoeuvre should succeed there would be little hope of any great resistance ralph had always taken for granted that his father would survive him that his own name would be the first grimly called
the father and son had been close companions and the idea of being left alone with the remnant of a tasteless life on his hands was not gratifying to the young man who had always and tacitly counted upon his elder's help in making the best of a poor business
at the prospect of losing his great motive ralph lost indeed his one inspiration
but without the encouragement of his father's society he should barely have patience to await his own turn he had not the incentive of feeling that he was indispensable to his mother it was a rule with his mother to have no regrets
he bethought himself of course that it had been a small kindness to his father to wish that of the two the active rather than the passive party should know the felt wound he remembered that the old man had always treated his own forecast of an early end as a clever fallacy
which he should be delighted to discredit so far as he might by dying first but of the two triumphs that of refuting a sophistical son and that of holding on a while longer to a state of being which with all abatements he enjoyed
he wondered whether he were harbouring love for this spontaneous young woman from albany but he judged that on the whole he was not after he had known her for a week he quite made up his mind to this and every day he felt a little more sure
lord warburton had been right about her she was a really interesting little figure ralph wondered how their neighbour had found it out so soon and then he said it was only another proof of his friend's high abilities
which he had always greatly admired if his cousin were to be nothing more than an entertainment to him ralph was conscious she was an entertainment of a high order a character like that he said to himself
a real little passionate force to see at play is the finest thing in nature it's finer than the finest work of art than a greek bas relief
than a gothic cathedral it's very pleasant to be so well treated where one had least looked for it i had never been more blue more bored than for a week before she came i had never expected less that anything pleasant would happen
a greek bas relief to stick over my chimney piece the key of a beautiful edifice is thrust into my hand and i'm told to walk in and admire my poor boy you've been sadly ungrateful
and now you had better keep very quiet and never grumble again the sentiment of these reflexions was very just
his cousin was a very brilliant girl
but she needed the knowing and his attitude with regard to her though it was contemplative and critical was not judicial he surveyed the edifice from the outside and admired it greatly
isabel's originality was that she gave one an impression of having intentions of her own whenever she executes them said ralph may i be there to see it devolved upon him of course to do the honours of the place
and his wife's position was that of rather a grim visitor so that in the line of conduct that opened itself to ralph duty and inclination were harmoniously mixed he was not a great walker but he strolled about the grounds with his cousin
a pastime for which the weather remained favourable with a persistency not allowed for in isabel's somewhat lugubrious prevision of the climate and in the long afternoons of which the length was but the measure of her gratified eagerness
they took a boat on the river the dear little river as isabel called it where the opposite shore seemed still a part of the foreground of the landscape or drove over the country in a phaeton a low capacious thick wheeled phaeton
but which he had now ceased to enjoy isabel enjoyed it largely and handling the reins in a manner which approved itself to the groom as knowing was never weary of driving her uncle's capital horses through winding lanes and byways
full of the rural incidents she had confidently expected to find past cottages thatched and timbered past ale houses latticed and sanded past patches of ancient common and glimpses of empty parks
between hedgerows made thick by midsummer when they reached home they usually found tea had been served on the lawn
but the two for the most part sat silent the old man with his head back and his eyes closed his wife occupied with her knitting and wearing that appearance of rare profundity with which some ladies consider the movement of their needles
one day however a visitor had arrived the two young persons after spending an hour on the river strolled back to the house and perceived lord warburton sitting under the trees and engaged in conversation
of which even at a distance the desultory character was appreciable with
he had driven over from his own place with a portmanteau and had asked as the father and son often invited him to do for a dinner and a lodging isabel seeing him for half an hour on the day of her arrival had discovered in this brief space that she liked him
he had indeed rather sharply registered himself on her fine sense and she had thought of him several times she had hoped she should see him again hoped too that she should see a few others gardencourt was not dull
the place itself was sovereign her uncle was more and more a sort of golden grandfather and ralph was unlike any cousin she had ever encountered her idea of cousins having tended to gloom then
her impressions were still so fresh and so quickly renewed that there was as yet hardly a hint of vacancy in the view but isabel had need to remind herself that she was interested in human nature and that her foremost hope in coming abroad
had been that she should see a great many people when ralph said to her as he had done several times i wonder you find this endurable you ought to see some of the neighbours and some of our friends
though you would never suppose it when he offered to invite what he called a lot of people and make her acquainted with english society she encouraged the hospitable impulse and promised in advance to hurl herself into the fray
little however for the present had come of his offers and it may be confided to the reader that if the young man delayed to carry them out it was because he found the labour of providing for his companion by no means so severe as to require extraneous help
isabel had spoken to him very often about specimens it was a word that played a considerable part in her vocabulary she had given him to understand that she wished to see english society illustrated by eminent cases
well now there's a specimen he said to her as they walked up from the riverside and he recognised lord warburton a specimen of what asked the girl a specimen of an english gentleman do you mean they're all like him
oh no they're not all like him
said isabel because i'm sure he's nice
the fortunate lord warburton exchanged a handshake with our heroine and hoped she was very well but i needn't ask that he said since you've been handling the oars i've been rowing a little isabel answered but how should you know it
oh i know he doesn't row he's too lazy said his lordship indicating ralph touchett with a laugh he has a good excuse for his laziness isabel rejoined lowering her voice a little ah he has a good excuse for everything
cried lord warburton still with his sonorous mirth my excuse for not rowing is that my cousin rows so well said ralph she does everything well she touches nothing that she doesn't adorn
it makes one want to be touched miss archer lord warburton declared
who if it pleased her to hear it said that her accomplishments were numerous was happily able to reflect that such complacency was not the indication of a feeble mind inasmuch as there were several things in which she excelled
had at least the element of humility that it always needed to be supported by proof lord warburton not only spent the night at gardencourt but he was persuaded to remain over the second day and when the second day was ended
he determined to postpone his departure till the morrow during this period he addressed many of his remarks to isabel who accepted this evidence of his esteem with a very good grace she found herself liking him extremely
the first impression he had made on her had had weight but at the end of an evening spent in his society she scarce fell short of seeing him though quite without luridity as a hero of romance
with a quickened consciousness of possible felicities it's very nice to know two such charming people as those she said meaning by those her cousin and her cousin's friend it must be added moreover
that an incident had occurred which might have seemed to put her good humour to the test
but his wife remained in the drawing room with the other members of the party she prolonged her vigil for something less than an hour and then rising observed to isabel that it was time they should bid the gentlemen good night isabel had as yet no desire to go to bed
the occasion wore to her sense a festive character and feasts were not in the habit of terminating so early so without further thought she replied very simply need i go dear aunt i'll come up in half an hour
it's impossible i should wait for you missus touchett answered
ralph will light my candle isabel gaily engaged i'll light your candle do let me light your candle miss archer
only i beg it shall not be before midnight
and transferred them coldly to her niece
you're not you're not at your blest albany my dear isabel rose blushing i wish i were she said oh i say mother ralph broke out
i must take it as i find it can't i stay with my own cousin isabel enquired i'm not aware that lord warburton is your cousin perhaps i had better go to bed the visitor suggested that will arrange it
missus touchett gave a little look of despair and sat down again
ralph meanwhile handed isabel her candlestick he had been watching her it had seemed to him her temper was involved an accident that might be interesting but if he had expected anything of a flare he was disappointed for the girl simply laughed a little
nodded good night and withdrew accompanied by her aunt for himself he was annoyed at his mother though he thought she was right above stairs the two ladies separated at missus touchett's door isabel had said nothing on her way up
isabel considered i'm not vexed but i'm surprised and a good deal mystified wasn't it proper i should remain in the drawing room not in the least young girls here in decent houses
don't sit alone with the gentlemen late at night you were very right to tell me then said isabel i don't understand it but i'm very glad to know it i shall always tell you her aunt answered whenever i see you taking what seems to me too much liberty
yes i think i'm very fond of them but i always want to know the things one shouldn't do so as to do them asked her aunt
and a girl called bellah postik they were cousins and as their mothers were great friends and constantly in and out of each other's houses they had often been laid in the same cradle and had played and fought over their games when they are grown up they will marry said the mothers
and soon they might have been heard bewailing to each other the hardness of their lots
i would rent a bit of ground from the master and then we could be married yes answered bellah with a deep sigh but we live in such hard times and at the last fair the price of pigs had risen again we shall have long to wait
that is quite clear replied houarn turning away to his work whenever they met they repeated their grievances and at length houarn's patience was exhausted and one morning he came to bellah and told her that he was going away to seek his fortune
the girl was very unhappy as she listened to this and felt sorry that she had not tried to make the best of things she implored houarn not to leave her but he would listen to nothing the birds he said continue flying until they reach a field of corn and
like them i shall seek till i get what i want that is money to buy a cow and a pig to fatten and if you love me bellah you won't attempt to hinder a plan which will hasten our marriage the girl saw it was useless to say more so she answered sadly
well go then since you must but first i will divide with you all that my parents left me and going to her room she opened a small chest and took from it a bell a knife and a little stick this bell she said can be heard at any distance however far
but it only rings to warn us that our friends are in great danger the knife frees all it touches from the spells that have been laid on them while the stick will carry you wherever you want to go i will give you the knife to guard you against the enchantments of wizards
and the bell to tell me of your perils the stick i shall keep for myself so that i can fly to you if ever you have need of me then they cried for a little on each other's necks and houarn started for the mountains but in those days as in these beggars abounded
and through every village he passed they followed houarn in crowds mistaking him for a gentleman because there were no holes in his clothes there is no fortune to be made here he thought to himself it is a place for spending and not earning i see i must go further
and he walked on to pont aven a pretty little town built on the bank of a river he was sitting on a bench outside an inn
and the men answered that it was the name given to the fairy that dwelt in the lake
and besought him not to be so mad and to throw away his life in such a foolish manner but he only laughed
but the men did not know how this was to be done and shaking their heads over his obstinacy left him to his fate
the island was large and lying almost across it was a lake with a narrow opening to the sea houarn paid the boatman and sent him away and then proceeded to walk round the lake
as soon as the young man had recovered from his surprise he prepared to jump into the lake and swim to shore but the bird had guessed his intentions and plunged beneath the water
the pink and white of her face reminded you of the shells of her palace while her long black hair was intertwined with strings of coral and her dress of green silk seemed formed out of the sea at the sight of her houarn stopped dazzled by her beauty
my name is houarn he answered
and she beckoned him to follow her into a second hall whose floors and walls were formed of pearls while down the sides there were tables laden with fruit and wines of all kinds
came from shipwrecked vessels and were brought to her palace by a magic current of water i do not wonder exclaimed houarn who now felt quite at home do not wonder that the people on the earth have so much to say about you the rich are always envied
the young man gazed at her in surprise could any one so rich and so beautiful really wish to be his wife he looked at her again and bellah was forgotten as he answered a man would be mad indeed to refuse such an offer i can only accept it with joy
when it was full she went into a large kitchen and threw them all into a golden pot
but it did not sound the least like that to houarn there it is again he said after a short pause
jump she replied but soon the noise grew louder and like cries what is it asked houarn beginning to feel uncomfortable just the crickets on the hearth said she and broke into a song which drowned the cries from the pot
but though houarn held his peace he was not as happy as before something seemed to have gone wrong and then he suddenly remembered bellah is it possible i can have forgotten her so soon
and four men stood before him houarn save us we entreat you and save yourself too murmured they not daring to raise their voices
and no sooner was the ceremony over than she turned us into fishes as she had done to all our forerunners who are in the fish pond still where you will shortly join them
it was at this very moment that bellah who was skimming the milk in the farm dairy heard the fairy bell tinkle violently at the sound she grew pale for she knew it meant that houarn was in danger
little staff of apple tree over the earth and over the sea up in the air be guide to me everywhere to wander free and immediately the stick became a smart little horse with a rosette at each ear and a feather on his forehead he stood quite still
the swallow is less swift than the wind the wind is less swift than the lightning but you my horse if you love me must be swifter than them all for there is a part of my heart that suffers the best part of my heart that is in danger and the horse heard her
and galloped like a straw carried along by a tempest till they reached the foot of a rock called the leap of the deer
to save you repeated bellah but who are you my little friend
and it is owing to her that i am here but what are you doing in this nest i am sitting on six eggs of stone and i shall not be set free till they are hatched
when you have found her you must contrive to get hold of the net of steel that hangs from her waist and shut her up in it for ever but where am i to find a young man's clothes asked she i will show you he replied
and the fourth an iron without waiting for orders they sat down in the nest and crossing their legs comfortably began to prepare the suit of clothes for bellah with one of the leaves of the cabbage they made her a coat
and with it in her hand she stepped into the blue boat which conducted her to the palace of shells the groac'h seemed overjoyed to see her and told her that never before had she beheld such a handsome young man
very soon she led her visitor into the great hall where wine and fruit were always waiting and on the table lay the magic knife left there by houarn
and to the pond which contained the fish their sides shining with a thousand different colours
and turning rapidly flung it over the witch's head become in body what you are in soul cried she and in an instant the lovely fairy of the sea was a toad horrible to look upon she struggled hard to tear the net asunder but it was no use
her eyes fell on a green frog on his knees beside her his little paws crossed over his little heart bellah felt as if fingers were tightening round her throat but she managed to cry is this you my houarn is this you it is i croaked the little frog
in a car drawn by six cockchafers which once had been the six stone eggs here i am he exclaimed you have broken the spell that held me and now come and get your reward and dismounting from his chariot he led them down into the caves filled with gold and jewels
and shoes with silver buckles the women were all filled with envy but little cared barbaik what they might whisper behind her back as long as she knew that her clothes were finer than anyone else's and that she had more partners than any other girl
and what was worse often made fun of him with the rest
one evening he was bringing back his horses from the fields and stopped at a little lake on the way home to let them drink he was tired with a long day's work and stood with his hand on the mane of one of the animals waiting till they had done and thinking all the while of barbaik
when a voice came out of the gorse close by
it is i the brownie of the lake replied the voice but where are you inquired jegu look close and you will see me among the reeds in the form of a little green frog i can take he added proudly any shape i choose
and even which is much harder be invisible if i want to then show yourself to me in the shape in which your family generally appear replied jegu certainly if you wish and the frog jumped on the back of one of the horses and changed into a little dwarf all dressed in green
at first under different animal shapes since that time partly from habit and partly to amuse ourselves we have continued to transform ourselves and it was in this way that i got to know you how exclaimed jegu filled with astonishment
but how are you going to do it exclaimed jegu wonderingly that is my affair perhaps i may tell you later meanwhile you just eat and sleep and don't worry yourself about anything
jegu declared that nothing could be easier and then taking off his hat he thanked the dwarf heartily and led his horses back to the farm next morning was a holiday and barbaik was awake earlier than usual
as she wished to get through her work as soon as possible and be ready to start for a dance which was to be held some distance off she went first to the cow house which it was her duty to keep clean but to her amazement she found fresh straw put down
the racks filled with hay the cows milked and the pails standing neatly in a row
and when she met him outside the door she stopped and thanked him for his help to be sure jegu only replied roughly that he didn't know what she was talking about but this answer made her feel all the more certain that it was he and nobody else
indeed barbaik had only to express a wish for it to be satisfied if the wind was cold or the sun was hot and she was afraid to go out lest her complexion should be spoilt she need only to run down to the spring close by and say softly i should like my churns to be full
and my wet linen to be stretched on the hedge to dry and she need never give another thought to the matter if she found the rye bread too hard to bake or the oven taking too long to heat she just murmured i should like to see my six loaves on the shelf above the bread box
why am i not already back from morlaix with my milk pot empty my butter bowl inside it a pound of wild cherries on my wooden plate and the money i have gained in my apron pocket and in the morning when she got up lo and behold
and six new pieces of silver in the pocket of her apron and she believed that all this was owing to jegu and she could no longer do without him even in her thoughts when things had reached this pass the brownie told the young man that he had better ask barbaik to marry him
and this time the girl did not turn rudely away but listened patiently to the end
and she could sleep every morning till breakfast time just like a young lady and as for the rest of the day
she would wear the beautiful dresses that came when she wished for them
barbaik was furious
her heart was filled with rage against the brownie who had caused her to expect a life of ease and pleasure but when she looked at jegu and beheld his red face squinting eyes and untidy hair her anger was doubled
while now i can receive no presents except from my husband i can never dance except with my husband oh you wretched dwarf i will never never forgive you in spite of her fierce words no one knew better than barbaik how to put her pride in her pocket when it suited her
and after receiving an invitation to a wedding she begged the brownie to get her a horse to ride there to her great joy he consented bidding her set out for the city of the dwarfs and to tell them exactly what she wanted
she had hardly spoken when the horse appeared and mounting on his back she started for the village where the wedding was to be held at first she was so delighted with the chance of a holiday from the work which she hated that she noticed nothing
but very soon it struck her as odd that as she passed along the roads full of people they all laughed as they looked at her horse at length she caught some words uttered by one man to another why the farmer's wife has sold her horse's tail and turned in her saddle
but it was of no use he declined to move out of a walk
so one day the brownie asked jegu if he might bring his friends to have supper in the great barn and whether he would allow them to dance there of course jegu was only too pleased to be able to do anything for the brownie and he ordered barbaik to spread her best table cloths in the barn
when all was ready the dwarfs in new green suits came bustling in very happy and merry and took their seats at the table but in a moment they all sprang up with a cry and ran away screaming for barbaik had placed pans of hot coals under their feet and all their poor little toes were burnt
you won't forget that in a hurry she said smiling grimly to herself but in a moment they were back again with large pots of water which they poured on the fire then they joined hands and danced round it singing wicked traitress
the wedding shuts one gate and opens another the longings and dreamings of courtship are at an end the supreme intimacy of life begins as john and mary move away from the altar pronounced man and wife they know they are starting a great adventure
his beaming face masks a stiff determination to keep his bride happy in spite of any worldly obstacles her radiance hides a solemn inward vow to do everything humanly possible to make smooth the way of their life together they are right
unless they are very different from most people this new joint enterprise is going to mean more to each of them than anything else ever can before them is a clear road not to happiness as they may believe but to the opportunity for gaining happiness
when one has received the promise of something greatly desired but must wait awhile before its delivery the happiness of the waiting period is characterized by the absence of a critical spirit and therefore is apt to be thought of as an experience of pure delight
but the first days of marriage bring out a different set of feelings those that come when one has definitely obtained possession of anything that before was only promised at first the emotions seem to stand still this is the long coveted moment then one begins to appraise
is the object of one's wishes as desirable as one had expected because reality rarely measures up to imagination the first answer is almost bound to be no this is not what i expected and the first emotion tends to be disappointment
regardless of hazy but optimistic expectations and the object possessed will more than likely turn out to be better than although different from what the imagination pictured knowing that a fleeting sense of disappointment is not peculiar to one's own marriage but likely to occur in all
roughly both the helps and the hindrances to married happiness can be lumped under one word personalities temperament mannerisms tastes all that is implied in the distinct individuality of each person make up the chief source of the advantages
and disadvantages with which the couple enter marriage these traits cannot be changed overnight nor is it necessary or at all wise that they should be john attracts mary and she appeals to him because the personality of each one is what it is
love has grown up between the two as a result of this personality attraction and love is the motive that will make both try to keep open the pathway to marriage success but love is not a finished product that once it comes can forever after be trusted to keep its strength
like everything else that is alive it must be kept growing through exercise or it wastes away love gives the push that keeps a marriage moving but it does not give the direction that comes from understanding and cooperation
this is what they must guard against while love is still the moving force of their lives they must study the problems that are due to come to wait until they are beset by them is to beg for trouble
in order to cope with their problems they must realize first that they cannot stumble upon married happiness that they must possess and cultivate a positive will to succeed
here are nine guideposts to help john and mary along their road one the first requirement is the building of a union that is just to both the smaller issues on which this rests are the lively clashes of opposite desires
inevitable in the coming together of any two persons intensified when those two persons are as different as a man and a woman and unavoidable for two committed to a lifetime together in the close quarters of marriage two
compromise will lift these essentially petty decisions of precedence above the level of selfishness decisions must be made on the basis of what is good for both not the selfish or narrow wish of either
the choice that brings the larger advantage to the two persons in their common role of marriage partners is the one to be made human judgment being as faulty as it is
in either situation the particular couple involved have to weigh delicately the effect on their joint enterprise of the conflicting courses of action much as mary may crave a child or a car
if each one is hurt at the other's inability to join instantly in his or her plans they will need to take pains not to get sidetracked into making a personal contest of the affair trying to win over your partner with a single eye to getting what you want
regardless of its effect on the mate is short sighted in the extreme even if you could care only for personal pleasure that cannot long outlast your spouse's displeasure staging a contest or a succession of small contests for the sake of finding out who is boss
builds up a habit of fighting that may lead to a bitter end it is useless to discover who can win in any particular skirmish what is important is to learn whether one of you is set on being head of the house if your spouse craves that distinction by all means hand it over without delay
it is an empty honor for the one who bends but does not break will readily develop the fine art of influencing the headstrong one because it is part of the traditional feminine character to enjoy giving in to the man this tendency must be scrutinized when it appears
no man can afford to be crippled for life by letting his wife swaddle him with solicitude as some mothers spoil their children for their own glorification a woman's feeling that she will be emotionally gratified by making a sacrifice does not prove that aside from her momentary pleasure
any individual woman may waver between a craving for self sacrifice and a repugnance to the very thought of it this changeableness can make her feel resentful after she has given in to her husband all this must be taken into account in making decisions
compromise not submission should be the rule if john forges ahead on one count mary must find an acceptable outlet for herself on some other front three
and the effort to do so to please the partner is liable to result in a topheavy hypocrisy a superstructure calculated to impress the observer but built on a shaky foundation of chaos
a chameleon changes color easily to match its environment or temper of the moment but a human being's more lasting change is not so readily made each marriage partner must be proud of the other and let the other continue to be proud of him or her
therefore you have to respect yourself and act as if you did even at home too many couples exploit the sense of let down that marriage brings with it after so long a time husband and wife cease to feel that they must exert themselves for each other in little matters
knowing themselves accepted they lounge mentally mannerly and physically when at home or elsewhere alone together some of this relaxation is a good thing but it is a mistake to let home and spouse degenerate into nothing more than an invitation to be lazy
using the mate for relief as in nagging whining crying or grumbling is taboo if you are tired or irritable you can rest or exercise for restoration as in the days before marriage
and dry up the source of refreshment you are trying to tap fatigue and nervousness expressed breed fatigue and nervousness in a sympathetic audience four too great concentration is to be avoided
even the greatest love stagnates if it is kept out of the main current of life to care only for each other is selfishness for two only one step removed from self centered engrossment
this is why the unique value of children is their service as an entering wedge in the close grown love of husband and wife a wedge that widens and holds forever wider the unity of love it has penetrated other responsibilities other interests may serve a similar purpose
though more easily dislodged and seldom striking so deep friends old and new have a function in relieving the overclose concern of one marriage partner with the other if they are to play their full part in preventing overconcentration
common friends are fine but for this purpose there is special need of friends for either spouse who can call forth those sides of his or her nature that are not aroused by the mate
the factor that underlies all the perplexities and most of the contentment of marriage is its unique degree of concentrated intimacy here the supreme testing always comes each means so much to the other
the wife may be alone part of the day and profit by it when john comes home at night he has not had that privilege
or by going out without his wife or by having his friends in when she is not around five the general level of emotion is what counts not the spectacular scaling of peaks staking all on high moments is melodrama with no comic relief
some husbands some wives are artists at achieving and momentarily living up to romantic settings but quickly flop down to the lower levels of decent fairness between the high spots of their sentimental flare ups others cannot utter a poetic phrase
make a romantic gesture or let their eyes show the quick intensity of their tender emotions if they must die for it this difference is one of make up and training not of marriage capacity the couple who are sure of each other's steady affection regardless of its expression in romantic interludes
another terrible moment that is due to come may seem even more frightening because it is you who are slipping soon or late you find that some familiar mannerism of your spouse displeases you it may be a slight uncouthness at table
now it vexes you and your vexation terrifies you does this mean that you no longer love your mate as you did you cannot help your change of feeling how then can you hope to keep your affection from disappearing altogether if it has already begun to wane
you remember other people you once thought you loved and wonder panic stricken how you can keep this love from dying as those other loves did this is probably an almost universal experience marking not the beginning of the end of love
maturity brings recognition of human imperfections in the most heroic but also develops the ability to weigh big and little things and to
always it is the unturned page the holds the answer to the question how goes it with this marriage the present is useful only as a foundation stone for the future which is being built up out of many fleeting present moments each quickly lost in the past
seven there can be no narrowing of marriage to mere sex adjustment
and the two persons have to work out a common life that means something to them over and above the pleasure they may take in each other's company as a continuing part of this life adjustment sex adjustment can develop into a permanent factor of married happiness
but without the larger adjustment the partial adjustment cannot be made in any fundamental and enduring form in the sex life in marriage as in other parts of the association each partner wins by considering the other before the self
but instead a complete trust in each other one who prides himself or herself on having to be handled with gloves has a great deal of growing up to do in order to be able to be an active partner in the marriage cry babying is no more helpful in marriage than in business or social life
in the healthy marriage this sympathetic response will soon give way to anger which in turn may have the effect of a dash of cold water in the face of the oversensitive one helping him or her to buck up and behave like an adult in the unhealthy marriage sympathy will grow into pity
the marriage partner who is mature will maintain trust in the other's good intentions in the face of what might seem to be occasions for hurt feelings a chief advantage of the married estate is its opportunity for frankness why doesn't his wife tell him of that unpleasant mannerism so he can correct it
mary may soon lose courage and relinquish her wifely job of husband improvement or the combination may be reversed frankness must go clothed in tact stiff minded people who are frank only when angry lose their case before they present it
if the expression of anger is to have its proper stimulative effect it has to be administered but rarely and then in small doses more has a paralyzing effect on the recipient
producing a response in kind that takes away the ability to think of anything except retaliation nine willingness to grow is the most necessary factor for success marriage is a life program of going on together that requires maturity
as this is an impossibility they are aware of increasing dissatisfaction that does not mean they are unadapted to each other they are afraid to leave the known pleasures of their first youth for the unguessed satisfactions of maturity so they try to stand still
hoping to keep their marriage unchanged in its first stage of promise if both husband and wife accept maturing responsibilities as they come their marriage relationship will keep pace with their own development and will therefore become increasingly satisfying to them

by stander one who is injured in a street fight
missus savareen sat up waiting for her lord until long past midnight but her vigil was in vain lapierre after closing up his inn for the night dropped in according to his promise to see if any news of the absentee had arrived
nothing further could be done in the way of searching for the latter personage until daylight it was getting on pretty well towards morning when missus savareen sought her couch and when she got there her slumber was broken and disturbed she knew not what to think
but she was haunted by a dread that she would never again see her husband alive next morning soon after daylight the whole neighborhood was astir and the country round was carefully searched for any trace of the missing man
squire harrington went down to town and made inquiries at the bank where he ascertained that the story told by savareen to old jonathan perry
was substantially correct this effectually disposed of any possible theory as to jonathan and his wife having mistaken somebody else for savareen squire harrington likewise learned all about the man's doings on the previous afternoon
and was able to fix the time at which he had started for home he had ridden from the door of the peacock at about a quarter to eight
perry professed to have seen and conversed with him there was no longer any room for doubt that interview and conversation had actually taken place at eight o'clock on the previous evening and savareen had ridden northward from the gate within five minutes afterwards he could not have proceeded more than a hundred
or at the very outside two hundred yards further or he must inevitably have been encountered by lapierre
but the horse which had disappeared in this unaccountable manner it seemed improbable that two living substances of such bulk should pass out of being and leave no trace behind them they must literally have melted into thin air no they hadn't at least the black mare hadn't
for she was discovered by several members of the searching party a little before noon when found she was quietly cropping the damp herbage at the edge of the cranberry swamp at the rear of squire harrington's farm she was wholly uninjured and had evidently spent the night there
the bit had been removed from her mouth but the bridle hung intact round her neck the saddle however like its owner had disappeared from her back then the men began a systematic search in the interior of the swamp they soon came upon the saddle which had apparently been deliberately unbuckled
and deposited on a dry patch of ground near the edge of the morass a little further in the interior they came upon a man's coat made of dark brown stuff
as belong to savareen it was wet and besmirched with mud and in fact was lying half in and half out of a little puddle of water when it was found then the searchers made sure of finding the body but in this they were disappointed
but found nothing further to reward their search the ground was too soft and marshy to retain any traces of footsteps and the mare and saddle furnished the only evidence that the object of their quest had been in the neighborhood of the swamp and of course this evidence was of the most vague and inconclusive character
then the party proceeded in a body to the missing man's house here another surprise awaited them the coat was at once recognised by missus savareen as belonging to her husband but it was not the coat worn by him at the time of his disappearance of this there was no doubt whatever
in fact he had not worn it for more than a week previously his wife distinctly remembered having folded and laid it away in the top of a large trunk on the saturday of the week before last since which time she had never set eyes on it here was a deepening of the mystery
the search was kept up without intermission for several days nearly all of the farmers in the vicinity taking part in it even to the neglect of the harvest work which demanded their attention squire harrington was especially active and left no stone unturned to unravel the mystery
lapierre gave up all his time to the search and left the royal oak to the care of its landlady the local constabulary bestirred themselves as they had never done before
where a man's body might possibly lie concealed every tract of bush and woodland every barn and out building every hollow and ditch every field and fence corner was explored with careful minuteness even the wells of the district were peered into
from off the face of the earth doctor scott the local coroner held himself in readiness to summon a coroner's jury at the shortest notice when all these measures proved unavailing a public meeting of the inhabitants was convened and funds were subscribed to still further prosecute the search
dead or alive or which should throw any light upon his fate hand bills proclaiming this reward and describing the man's personal appearance were exhibited in every bar room and other conspicuous place throughout westchester and the adjacent townships
advertisements setting forth the main facts were inserted in the principal newspapers of toronto hamilton and london
chapter seven the amazing meeting in the shadows of the old courtyard bobby returned to his bed he lay there still shivering beneath the heavy blankets i don't dare he echoed graham's words there's nothing else any one can say
i must decide what to do i must think it over but as always thought brought no release it merely insisted that the case against him was proved at last he had been seen slipping unconsciously from his room and at the same hour
all that remained was to learn how he had accomplished the apparent miracles
the woman at the lake and in the courtyard the movement of the body and the vanishing of the evidence under his hand paredes's odd behaviour all became in his mind puzzling details that failed to obscure the chief fact
after this something must be done about paredes's detention he hadn't dreamed that his weariness could placate even momentarily such reflections but at last he slept again
he was aroused by the tramping of men around the house and strange harsh voices he raised himself on his elbow and glanced from the window it had long been daylight two burly fellows in overalls carrying pick and spade across their shoulders
pushed through the underbrush at the edge of the clearing he turned graham fully dressed stood at the side of the bed those men bobby asked wearily the grave diggers graham answered they are going to work in the old cemetery to prepare a place for silas blackburn
that's why i've come to wake you up the minister's telephoned katherine he will be here before noon do you know it's after ten o'clock for some time bobby stared through the window at the desolate ragged landscape it was abnormally cold even for the late fall
dull clouds obscured the sun and furnished an illusion of crowding earthward a funereal day the words slipped into his mind he repeated them when your grandfather's buried graham answered softly we'll all feel happier why bobby asked
it won't lessen the fact of his murder time graham said lessens such facts even for the police bobby glanced at him flushing you mean you've decided to stand by me after what happened last night graham smiled
i slept like a top last night i heard nothing i saw nothing ought i to want you to stand by me bobby said oughtn't i to make a clean breast of it
graham frowned it's hard to believe he had any connection with your sleep walking last night yet it's as clear as ever that maria and he are up to some game in which you figure he shouldn't be in jail bobby persisted get up graham advised
bathe and have some breakfast then we can decide there's no use talking of the other thing i've forgotten it as far as possible you must bobby sprang upright how can i forget it
have i any right don't graham said i'll be with you again to night
when bobby had bathed and dressed he found in spite of his mental turmoil that his sleep had done him good while he breakfasted graham urged him to eat tried to drive from his brain the morbid aftermath of last night's revealing moment
the manager took my advice but maria's still missing
he strolled over and handed bobby a number of newspapers where's robinson bobby asked i saw him in the court a while ago i daresay he's wandering around perhaps watching the men at the grave he learned nothing new last night i was with him at breakfast i gather not
bobby looked up isn't that an automobile coming through the woods he asked maybe rawlins back from smithtown or the minister the car stopped at the entrance of the court they heard the remote tinkling of the front door bell jenkins passed through
his sharp exclamation recalled howells's report which at their direction he had failed to mail had his exclamation been drawn by an accuser bobby started to rise graham moved toward the door then jenkins entered and stood to one side
the former easy mannered uncommunicative foreigner he appeared moreover to have slept pleasantly his eyes showed no weariness his clothing no disarrangement he spoke at once
overcoat i've nearly frozen driving from smithtown before either man could grope for a suitable greeting he faced bobby
fact is bobby i left new york too suddenly
you see i spent a good deal in smithtown yesterday
graham interrupted with a flat demand for an explanation how did you get away
later mister graham there is a hack driver outside who is even more suspicious than you he wants to be paid i asked rawlins to drive me back but he rushed from the courthouse probably to telephone his rotund superior
bobby handed him a banknote he didn't miss graham's meaning glance
pay him will you jenkins thanks
why he should fail to refer to bobby's questions at the moment of his arrest or to the openly expressed enmity of graham only one theory promised to fit at all it was necessary for the panamanian to return to the cedars
compelled him to remain for the present in the mournful tragic house therefore he would crush his justifiable anger
and he had asked for money only a trifling sum yet graham would grasp at the fact to support his earlier suspicion paredes's arrival possessed one virtue it diverted bobby's thoughts temporarily from his own dilemma from his inability to chart a course
graham on the other hand was ill at ease
for him yesterday's incident was not so lightly to be passed over eventually his curiosity conquered the words came nevertheless with some difficulty
we took it for granted you would find it necessary to stay in smithtown for a while
simple enough mister graham i telephoned as soon as rawlins got me to the bastille i communicated with the lawyer who represents the company for which i once worked he's a prominent and brilliant man he planned it with some local fellow when i was arraigned at the opening of court this morning
the judge could hold me only as a material witness he fixed a pretty stiff bail but the local lawyer was there with a bondsman and i came back my clothes are here you don't mind bobby that moment in the hall when graham had awakened him urged bobby to reply with a genuine warmth
i don't mind i'm glad you're out of it
your presence in the private staircase was the last straw you will forgive us carlos
he smoked with a vast contentment that's better nothing to forgive bobby let us call it a misunderstanding graham moved closer
his eyes still smiled but his voice was harder bygones are bygones isn't that so bobby since you wish it bobby said but more important than the knowledge graham desired loomed the old question what was the man's game what held him here
robinson entered the flesh around his eyes was puffier than it had been yesterday worry had increased the incongruous discontent of his round face clearly he had slept little i saw you arrive he said rawlins warned me
but i must say i didn't think you'd use your freedom to come to us
since the law won't hold me at your convenience in smithtown i keep myself at your service here if bobby permits it could you ask more bobby shrank from the man with whom he had idled away so much time and money
that fleeting satanic impression of yesterday came back sharper more alarming paredes's clear challenge to the district attorney was the measure of his strength his mind was subtler than theirs
his reserve and easy daring mastered them all and always as now he laughed at the futility of their efforts to sound his purposes to limit his freedom of action bobby didn't care to meet the uncommunicative eyes whose depths he had never been able to explore
that might make men walk unconsciously to accomplish the ends of an unscrupulous brain the district attorney appeared as much at sea as the others
and glancing at bobby he asked with a hollow scorn you've no objection to the gentleman visiting you for the present if he wishes bobby answered
robinson jerked his head toward the window i've been watching the preparations out there
no hurry bobby answered with a quick intake of breath i suppose not robinson sneered since everybody knows well enough what's in it bobby arose robinson still sneered you'll be at the grave as chief mourner
bobby walked from the room he hadn't cared to reply he feared as it was that he had let slip his increased self doubt he put on his coat and hat and left the house the raw cold the year's first omen of winter made his blood run quicker
forced into his mind a cleansing stimulation but almost immediately even that prophylactic was denied him with his direction a matter of indifference chance led him into the thicket at the side of the house he had walked some distance
the underbrush had long interposed a veil between him and the cedars above whose roofs smoke wreathed in the still air like fantastic figures weaving a shroud to lower over the time stained melancholy walls
for once he was grateful to the forest because it had forbidden him to glance perpetually back at that dismal and pensive picture then he became aware of twigs hastily lopped off of bushes bent and torn of the uncovering through these careless means of an old path
the dull thud of earth falling regularly he paused listening the labour of the men was given an uncouth rhythm by their grunting expulsions of breath otherwise the nature of their industry and its surroundings had imposed upon them a silence
in itself beast like and unnatural at last a harsh voice came to bobby its brevity pointed the previous dumbness of the speaker deep enough and bobby turned and hurried back along the roughly restored path
as if fleeing from an immaterial thing suddenly quickened with the power of accusation he could picture the fresh oblong excavation in the soil of the family burial ground
there was an ironical justice in the condition of the old cemetery it had received no interment since the death of katherine's father like everything about the cedars silas blackburn had delivered it to the swift obliterating fingers of time
if the old man in his selfishness had paused to gaze beyond the inevitable fact of death
he would have guarded with a more precious interest the drapings of his final sleep this necessary task on which bobby had stumbled had made the thicket less congenial than the house as he walked back he forecasted with a keen apprehension his approaching ordeal
could he witness the definite imprisonment of his grandfather in a narrow box could he watch the covering earth fall noisily in that bleak place of silence without displaying for robinson
a strange man appeared walking from the direction of the house his black clothing relieved only by narrow edges of white cuffs between the sleeves and the heavy mourning gloves fitted with solemn harmony into the landscape and bobby's mood
such a figure was appropriate to the cedars
he emerged from the forest and saw again the leisurely weaving of the smoke shroud above the house then his eyes were drawn by the restless movements of a pair of horses
no likely path yet whose crossing is the price of salvation he was glad to see graham leave the court and hurry toward him i was coming to hunt you up bobby the minister's arrived so has doctor groom everything's about ready doctor groom
it's natural enough he should be here bobby agreed indifferently they walked slowly back to the house graham made it plain that his mind was far from the sad business ahead
he asked he ignores what happened yesterday he settles himself in the cedars again i don't know what to think of it bobby answered this morning carlos gave me the creeps
he spoke with pronounced deliberation startling bobby
gave me the creeps too makes me surer than ever that he has an abominably deep purpose in using his wits to hang on here he suggests resources as hard to understand as anything that has happened in the old room you'll confess bobby he's had a good deal of influence over you an influence for evil
i won't blame carlos for that bobby muttered he influenced you against your better judgment graham persisted to refuse to leave with me the night of your grandfather's death maria did her share bobby said he broke off looking at graham what are you driving at
i've been asking myself since he came back graham answered if there's any queer power behind his quiet manner maybe he is psychic maybe he can do things we don't understand i've wondered if he had without your knowing it
acquired sufficient influence to direct your body when your mind no longer controlled it it's a nasty thought but i've heard of such things you mean carlos may have made me go to the hall last night perhaps sent me to the old room those other times
no i won't believe it i've been weak hartley but not that weak and i tell you i did feel howells's body move under my hand don't misunderstand me graham said gently i must consider every possibility you were excited and imaginative when you went to the old room to take the evidence
might have moved spasmodically i mean
and the disappearance of the evidence bobby defended himself if it had been stolen earlier the coat pocket might have retained its bulging shape
but i was there and you weren't
if it's so far fetched graham asked quietly why do you revolt from the idea bobby turned on him and why do you fill my mind with such thoughts if you think i'm guilty say so go tell robinson so
he glanced away while the angry colour left his face he was a little dazed by the realization that he had spoken to graham as he might have done to an enemy as he had spoken to howells in the old bedroom he felt the touch of graham's hand on his shoulder i'm only working in your service graham said kindly
for groom has brought the ghosts back with him don't make any mistake about that you want the truth don't you yes bobby said even if it does for me
yet that flash of temper had given him courage to face the ordeal a lingering resentment at graham's suggestion lessened the difficulty of his position entering the court he scarcely glanced at the black wagon there were more dark clothed men in the hall rawlins had returned
the panamanian had changed his clothing he too was sombrely dressed and instead of the vivid necktie he had worn from the courthouse a jet black scarf was perfectly arranged beneath his collar he lounged opposite the district attorney
his eyes studying the fire his fingers on the chair arm were restless doctor groom stood at the foot of the stairs talking with the clergyman a stout and unctuous figure
from his thickly bearded face his reddish eyes gleamed forth with a fresh instability the clergyman shook hands with bobby we need not delay your cousin is upstairs he included the company in his circling turn of the head any one who cares to go
bobby forced himself to walk up the staircase facing the first phase of his ordeal he saw that the district attorney realized that too for he sprang from his chair and followed by rawlins started upward the entire company crowded the stairs
graham summoned katherine one of the black clothed men opened the door of silas blackburn's room he stepped aside beckoning
bobby went in with the others automatically through the dim light he catalogued remembered objects all intimate to his grandfather each oddly entangled in his mind with his dislike of the old man the iron bed the chest of drawers
scratched and with broken handles the closed colonial desk the miserly rag carpet all seemed mutely asking as bobby did
from the chest of drawers two candles the only light

that you may be able to see this matter of perfumes from our standpoint
he was obliged from time to time to visit his correspondents on business and one day being under the necessity of going a long journey on an affair of importance he took horse and carried with him a wallet containing biscuits and dates
because he had a great desert to pass over where he could procure no sort of provisions he arrived without any accident at the end of his journey and having dispatched his affairs took horse again in order to return home
the fourth day of his journey he was so much incommoded by the heat of the sun and the reflection of that heat from the earth
having alighted he tied his horse to a branch and sitting down by the fountain took some biscuits and dates out of his wallet as he ate his dates he threw the shells carelessly in different directions when he had finished his repast
being a good moosulmaun he washed his hands face and feet and said his prayers before he had finished and while he was yet on his knees he saw a genie white with age
the genie spoke to him in a terrible voice rise that i may kill thee with this cimeter as thou hast killed my son and accompanied these words with a frightful cry
the merchant being as much alarmed at the hideous shape of the monster as at his threatening language answered him trembling alas my good lord of what crime can i be guilty towards you that you should take away my life
demanded the genie did you not take dates out of your wallet
i did all that you say answered the merchant i cannot deny it if it be so resumed the genie i tell thee that thou hast killed my son and in this manner when thou wert throwing the shells about my son was passing by
and thou didst throw one into his eye which killed him therefore i must kill thee
pardon me cried the merchant no pardon exclaimed the genie no mercy is it not just to kill him that has killed another
replied the merchant but certainly i never killed your son and if i have it was unknown to me and i did it innocently i beg you therefore to pardon me and suffer me to live no no returned the genie
persisting in his resolution i must kill thee since thou hast killed my son then taking the merchant by the arm he threw him with his face on the ground and lifted up his cimeter to cut off his head the merchant with tears
protested he was innocent bewailed his wife and children and supplicated the genie in the most moving expressions the genie with his cimeter still lifted up had the patience to hear his unfortunate victims to the end of his lamentations
all this whining said the monster is to no purpose
what exclaimed the merchant can nothing prevail with you will you absolutely take away the life of a poor innocent yes replied the genie i am resolved
as soon as she had spoken these words perceiving it was day and knowing that the sultan rose early in the morning to say his prayers and hold his council scheherazade discontinued her story dear sister said dinarzade
the remainder of it replied scheherazade is more surprising and you will be of this opinion if the sultan will but permit me to live over this day
i will wait till to morrow for i can at any time put her to death when she has concluded her story having thus resolved not to put scheherazade to death that day he rose and went to his prayers and to attend his council
instead of sleeping he spent the night in sighs and groans bewailing the lot of his daughter of whom he believed he should himself shortly be the executioner as with this melancholy prospect before him he dreaded to meet the sultan
he was agreeably surprised when he found the prince entered the council chamber without giving him the fatal orders he expected the sultan according to his custom spent the day in regulating his affairs and when the night had closed in retired with scheherazade
the next morning before day dinarzade failed not to call to her sister my dear sister if you be not asleep i pray you till day break which is very near to go on with the story you began last night
the sultan without waiting for scheherazade to ask his permission bade her proceed with the story of the genie and the merchant upon which scheherazade continued her relation as follows f n
in the original work scheherazade continually breaks off to ask the sultan to spare her life for another day that she may finish the story she is relating as these interruptions considerably interfere with the continued interest of the stories it has been deemed advisable to omit them
for heaven's sake hold your hand allow me one word
to bid my wife and children adieu and
that they may not go to law after my death when i have done this i will come back and submit to whatever you shall please to command but said the genie if i grant you the time you ask i doubt you will never return
if you will believe my oath answered the merchant i swear by all that is sacred that i will come and meet you here without fail what time do you require then demanded the genie
i ask a year said the merchant i cannot in less settle my affairs and prepare myself to die without regret but i promise you that this day twelve months i will return under these trees
to put myself into your hands do you take heaven to be witness to this promise said the genie i do answered the merchant and you may rely on my oath upon this the genie left him near the fountain and disappeared
the merchant being recovered from his terror mounted his horse and proceeded on his journey
but grieved on the other when he reflected on his fatal oath when he reached home his wife and children received him with all the demonstrations of perfect joy but he instead of returning their caresses wept so bitterly
that his family apprehended something calamitous had befallen him
we are all overjoyed said she at your return but you alarm us by your lamentations pray tell us the cause of your sorrow alas replied the husband i have but a year to live
he then related what had passed betwixt him and the genie and informed her that he had given him his oath to return at the end of the year to receive death from his hands when they heard this afflicting intelligence they all began to lament in the most distressing manner
the children all in tears made the house resound with their groans and the father not being able to resist the impulse of nature mingled his tears with theirs so that in a word they exhibited the most affecting spectacle possible
on the following morning the merchant applied himself to put his affairs in order and first of all to pay his debts he made presents to his friends gave liberal alms to the poor
he gave her in addition as much as the law would allow him at last the year expired and he was obliged to depart he put his burial clothes in his wallet but when he came to bid his wife and children adieu their grief surpassed description
when however it became necessary for him to tear himself from these dear objects he addressed them in the following terms my dear wife and children i obey the will of heaven in quitting you follow my example
submit with fortitude to this necessity and consider that it is the destiny of man to die having thus spoken he went out of the hearing of the cries of his family and pursuing his journey arrived on the day appointed
an old man leading a hind appeared and drew near him
brother may i ask why you are come into this desert place which is possessed solely by evil spirits and where consequently you cannot be safe from the beautiful trees which are seen here one might indeed suppose the place inhabited
he then seated himself by the merchant and they entered into conversation but i see day said scheherazade and must leave off yet the best of the story is to come the sultan resolving to hear the end of it
suffered her to live that day also the next morning dinarzade made the same request to her sister as before my dear sister said she
but the sultan wishing to learn what followed betwixt the merchant and the genie bade her proceed with that which she did as follows sir while the merchant and the old man who led the hind were conversing
they saw another old man coming towards them followed by two black dogs
the old man with the hind told him the adventure of the merchant and genie with all that had passed between them particularly the merchant's oath
they had scarcely begun to converse together when there arrived a third old man leading a mule he addressed himself to the two former and asked why the merchant who sat with them looked so melancholy they told him the reason
which appeared to him so extraordinary
the merchant and the three old men began to lament and fill the air with their cries when the old man who led the hind saw the genie lay hold of the merchant and about to kill him
i will tell you the history of my life and of the hind you see and if you think it more wonderful and surprising than the adventure of the merchant i hope you will pardon the unfortunate man a third of his offence
what is more my wife she was only twelve years of age when i married her so that i may justly say she ought to regard me equally as her father her kinsman and her husband
we lived together twenty years without any children her barrenness did not effect any change in my love i still treated her with much kindness and affection
my desire of having children only induced me to purchase a slave by whom i had a son who was extremely promising my wife being jealous cherished a hatred for both mother and child
but concealed her aversion so well that i knew nothing of it till it was too late mean time my son grew up and was ten years old when i was obliged to undertake a long journey
before i went i recommended to my wife of whom i had no mistrust the slave and her son and prayed her to take care of them during my absence which was to be for a whole year
she however employed that time to satisfy her hatred she applied herself to magic
the wretch carried my son to a desolate place where by her enchantments she changed him into a calf and gave him to my farmer to fatten pretending she had bought him
her enmity did not stop at this abominable action but she likewise changed the slave into a cow and gave her also to my farmer at my return i enquired for the mother and child
your slave said she is dead and as for your son i know not what is become of him i have not seen him this two months i was afflicted at the death of the slave
but as she informed me my son had only disappeared i was in hopes he would shortly return however eight months passed and i heard nothing of him when the festival of the great bairam was to be celebrated
the unfortunate mother of my son i bound her but as i was going to sacrifice her she bellowed piteously and i could perceive tears streaming from her eyes this seemed to me very extraordinary
and finding myself moved with compassion i could not find in my heart to give her a blow but ordered my farmer to get me another my wife who was present was enraged at my tenderness
and resisting an order which disappointed her malice she cried out what are you doing husband sacrifice that cow your farmer has not a finer nor one fitter for the festival out of deference to my wife i came again to the cow
and combating my compassion which suspended the sacrifice was going to give her the fatal blow when the victim redoubling her tears and bellowing disarmed me a second time
i then put the mallet into the farmer's hands and desired him to take it and sacrifice her himself for her tears and bellowing pierced my heart the farmer less compassionate than myself sacrificed her
though to she seemed very fat take her yourself said i to him
i did not enquire what he did with the cow but soon after he had taken her away he returned with a fat calf though i knew not the calf was my son yet i could not forbear being moved at the sight of him on his part
as soon as he beheld me he made so great an effort to come near me that he broke his cord
with his head against the ground as if he meant to excite my compassion conjuring me not to be so cruel as to take his life and did as much as was possible for him to signify that he was my son
i was more surprised and affected with this action than with the tears of the cow i felt a tender pity which interested me on his behalf or rather nature did its duty
go said i to the farmer carry home that calf take great care of him and bring me another in his stead immediately as soon as my wife heard me give this order she exclaimed what are you about husband
take my advice sacrifice no other calf but that wife i replied i will not sacrifice him i will spare him and pray do not you oppose me
the wicked woman had no regard to my wishes she hated my son too much to consent that i should save him i tied the poor creature and taking up the fatal knife was going to plunge it into my son's throat
when turning his eyes bathed with tears in a languishing manner towards me he affected me so much that i had not strength to kill him i let the knife fall and told my wife positively
that i would have another calf to sacrifice and not that she used all her endeavours to persuade me to change my resolution but i continued firm
i come said he to communicate to you a piece of intelligence for which i hope you will return me thanks i have a daughter that has some skill in magic yesterday
these two metamorphoses were made by the enchantments of our master's wife who hated both the mother
this is what my daughter told me said the farmer and i come to acquaint you with it i leave you to judge how much i was surprised i went immediately to my farmer to speak to his daughter myself
as soon as i arrived i went forthwith to the stall where my son was kept he could not return my embraces but received them in such a manner as fully satisfied me he was my son
my good maid said i can you restore my son to his former shape yes she replied i can
except on two conditions the first is that you give him to me for my husband and the second that you allow me to punish the person who changed him into a calf as to the first i replied
as to what relates to my wife i also agree a person who has been capable of committing such a criminal action justly deserves to be punished
only i must pray you not to take her life i am going then answered she to treat her as she treated your son to this i consent said i
provided you first of all restore to me my son
pronounced over it words that i did not understand and addressing herself to the calf o calf if thou west created by the almighty and sovereign master of the world such as thou appearest at this time continue in that form
but if thou be a man and art changed into a calf by enchantment return to thy natural shape by the permission of the sovereign creator as she spoke she threw water upon him
and in an instant he recovered his natural form my son
with such a transport of joy that i knew not what i was doing it is heaven that hath sent us this young maid to remove the horrible charm by which you were enchanted and to avenge the injury done to you and your mother i doubt not
but in acknowledgment you will make your deliverer your wife as i have promised he joyfully consented but before they married she changed my wife into a hind and this is she whom you see here
i desired she might have this shape rather than another less agreeable that we might see her in the family without horror since that time my son is become a widower and gone to travel
it being now several years since i heard of him i am come abroad to inquire after him and not being willing to trust anybody with my wife till i should return home i thought fit to take her everywhere with me
this is the history of myself and this hind is it not one of the most wonderful and surprising i admit it is said the genie and on that account forgive the merchant one third of his crime
the story of the grecian king
there was in the country of yunaun or greece a king who was leprous and his physicians had in vain endeavoured his cure
arrived at his court this physician had learnt the theory of his profession in greek persian turkish arabic latin syriac and hebrew books he was an experienced natural philosopher
i know said he after the usual ceremonials that your majesty's physicians have not been able to heal you of the leprosy but if you will accept my service i will engage to cure you without potions
or external applications the king listened to what he said and answered if you be able to perform what you promise i will enrich you and your posterity
do you assure me that you will cure my leprosy without potion or applying any external medicine yes sire replied the physician i promise myself success through god's assistance
and to morrow with your majesty's permission i will make the trial the physician returned to his quarters made a hollow mace and at the handle he put in his drugs
with which next morning he presented himself before the king and falling down at his feet kissed the ground
and after a profound reverence said to the king he judged it meet that his majesty should take horse
the king did so and when he arrived there the physician came to him with the mace and said exercise yourself with this mace and strike the ball until you find your hands and body perspire
when the medicine i have put up in the handle of the mace is heated with your hand it will penetrate your whole body and as soon as you perspire you may leave off the exercise
immediately on your return to your palace go into the bath and cause yourself to be well washed and rubbed then retire to bed and when you rise to morrow you will find yourself cured
the king took the mace and struck the ball which was returned by his officers who played with him he played so long that his hands and his whole body were in a sweat and then the medicine shut up in the handle of the mace had its operation
as the physician had said upon this the king left off play returned to his palace entered the bath and observed very exactly his physician had prescribed to him
the next morning when he arose he perceived with equal wonder and joy that his leprosy was cured and his body as clean as if it had never been affected as soon as he was dressed he came into the hall of audience where he ascended his throne
and shewed himself to his courtiers who eager to know the success of the new medicine came thither betimes and when they saw the king perfectly cured expressed great joy
bowed himself before the throne with his face to the ground the king perceiving him made him sit down by his side presented him to the assembly and gave him all the commendation he deserved
but as he treated all his court that day made him eat at his table alone with him
but caused him to be clad in a rich robe
continued every day to load him with new favours but this king had a vizier who was avaricious envious and naturally capable of every kind of mischief
he could not behold without envy the presents that were given to the physician whose other merits had already begun to make him jealous
to effect this he went to the king and told him in private that he had some information of the greatest consequence to communicate the king having asked what it was sire said he
it is highly dangerous for a monarch to confide in a man whose fidelity he has never tried
i am well informed of what i have had the honour to reveal to your majesty therefore do not rest in dangerous security if your majesty be asleep be pleased to awake
and came to settle himself at your court for the sole purpose of executing the horrible design which i have intimated no no vizier interrupted the king
i am certain that this physician whom you suspect to be a villain and a traitor is one of the best and most virtuous of men you know by what medicine or rather by what miracle he cured me of my leprosy
if he had had a design upon my life why did he save me then he needed only to have left me to my disease i could not have escaped it as life was fast decaying forbear then to fill me with unjust suspicions
instead of listening to you i tell you that from this day forward i will give that great man a pension of a thousand pieces of gold per month for his life nay though i were to share with him all my riches and dominions
i should never pay him sufficiently for what he has done i perceive it to be his virtue that raises your envy but do not think i will be unjustly prejudiced against him i remember too well what a vizier said to king sinbad his master
to prevent his putting to death the prince his son what the grecian king said about king sinbad raised the vizier's curiosity who said i pray your majesty to pardon me
if i have the boldness to ask what the vizier of king sinbad said to his master to divert him from putting the prince his son to death the grecian king had the condescension to satisfy him that vizier said he
after having represented to king sinbad that he ought to beware lest on the accusation of a mother in law he should commit an action of which he might afterwards repent
chapter thirty five she tried to be content which was a contradiction in terms she fanatically cleaned house all april she knitted a sweater for hugh she was diligent at red cross work
she was silent when vida raved that though america hated war as much as ever we must invade germany and wipe out every man because it was now proven that there was no soldier in the german army who was not crucifying prisoners
very old and weak who a few decades ago had been boys and girls of the frontier riding broncos through the rank windy grass of this prairie they hobbled behind a band made up of business men and high school boys
champ was broken his rheumatism was worse the rooms over the store were silent he could not do his work as buyer at the elevator farmers coming in with sled loads of wheat complained that champ could not read the scale
that he seemed always to be watching some one back in the darkness of the bins he was seen slipping through alleys talking to himself trying to avoid observation creeping at last to the cemetery once carol followed him
and found the coarse tobacco stained unimaginative old man lying on the snow of the grave his thick arms spread out across the raw mound as if to protect her from the cold her
who was alone there now uncared for the elevator company ezra stowbody president let him go the company ezra explained to carol had no funds for giving pensions she tried to have him appointed to the postmastership
which since all the work was done by assistants was the one sinecure in town the one reward for political purity but it proved that mister bert tybee the former bartender desired the postmastership at her solicitation
lyman cass gave champ a warm berth as night watchman
he was well but still weak from having been gassed he had been discharged and he came home as the first of the war veterans it was rumored that he surprised vida by coming unannounced that vida fainted when she saw him and for a night and day
would not share him with the town when carol saw them vida was hazy about everything except raymie and never went so far from him that she could not slip her hand under his without understanding why carol was troubled by this intensity
and raymie surely this was not raymie but a sterner brother of his this man with the tight blouse the shoulder emblems the trim legs in boots his face seemed different his lips more tight he was not raymie
he was major wutherspoon and kennicott and carol were grateful when he divulged that paris wasn't half as pretty as minneapolis that all of the american soldiers had been distinguished by their morality when on leave kennicott was respectful
to the half dozen branch stores which he was establishing at crossroads hamlets harry would be the town's rich man in the coming generation and major wutherspoon would rise with him and vida was jubilant though she was regretful at having to give up
most of her red cross work ray still needed nursing she explained when carol saw him with his uniform off in a pepper and salt suit and a new gray felt hat she was disappointed he was not major wutherspoon he was raymie
for a month small boys followed him down the street and everybody called him major
the wheat money did not remain in the pockets of the farmers the towns existed to take care of all that iowa farmers were selling their land at four hundred dollars an acre and coming into minnesota but whoever bought or sold or mortgaged
the townsmen invited themselves to the feast millers real estate men lawyers merchants and doctor will kennicott they bought land at a hundred and fifty sold it next day at a hundred and seventy and bought again
in three months kennicott made seven thousand dollars which was rather more than four times as much as society paid him for healing the sick in early summer began a campaign of boosting
but also the perfect site for factories summer cottages and state institutions in charge of the campaign was mister james blausser who had recently come to town to speculate in land mister blausser was known as a hustler
he liked to be called honest jim
nice lil wifey i'll say doc and when she answered not warmly thank you very much for the imprimatur he blew on her neck and did not know that he had been insulted
he was a layer on of hands he never came to the house without trying to paw her he touched her arm let his fist brush her side she hated the man and she was afraid of him she wondered if he had heard of erik and was taking advantage
she spoke ill of him at home and in public places but kennicott and the other powers insisted maybe he is kind of a roughneck
chucked him in the ribs and said say boy
wait ll i get time and i'll move the mountains here any mountain will be tickled to death to locate here once we get the white way in the town welcomed mister blausser as fully as carol snubbed him
he was the guest of honor at the commercial club banquet at the minniemashie house an occasion for menus printed in gold but injudiciously proof read for free cigars soft damp slabs of lake superior whitefish served as fillet of sole
drenched cigar ashes gradually filling the saucers of coffee cups and oratorical references to pep punch go vigor enterprise red blood he men fair women god's country james j hill
the bountiful harvest increasing population fair return on investments alien agitators who threaten the security of our institutions the hearthstone the foundation of the state senator knute nelson one hundred per cent americanism and
pointing with pride harry haydock as chairman introduced honest jim blausser and i am proud to say my fellow citizens that in his brief stay here mister blausser has become my warm personal friend as well as my fellow booster
and i advise you all to very carefully attend to the hints of a man who knows how to achieve mister blausser reared up like an elephant with a camel's neck red faced red eyed heavy fisted slightly belching a born leader
there's a lot of folks even right here in this fair state fairest and richest of all the glorious union that stand up on their hind legs and claim that the east and europe put it all over the golden northwestland now let me nail that lie right here and now
ah ha says they so jim blausser is claiming that gopher prairie is as good a place to live in as london and rome and and all the rest of the big burgs is he how does the poor fish know says they well
i'll tell you how i know i've seen em i've done europe from soup to nuts they can't spring that stuff on jim blausser and get away with it and let me tell you that the only live thing in europe is our boys that are fighting there now london
and the same thing goes for that crowd of crabs and snobs down east and next time you hear some zob from yahooville on the hudson chewing the rag and bulling and trying to get your goat you tell him that no two fisted enterprising westerner would have new york for a gift
now the point of this is i'm not only insisting that gopher prairie is going to be minnesota's pride the brightest ray in the glory of the north star state
and bring up the little ones in and it's got as much refinement and culture as any burg on the whole bloomin expanse of god's green footstool and that goes get me that goes
half an hour later chairman haydock moved a vote of thanks to mister blausser the boosters campaign was on the town sought that efficient and modern variety of fame which is known as publicity
the band was reorganized and provided by the commercial club with uniforms of purple and gold the amateur baseball team hired a semi professional pitcher from des moines
boost boys and boost together put gopher prairie on the map brilliant record of our matchless team then glory of glories the town put in a white way white ways were in fashion in the middlewest
they were composed of ornamented posts with clusters of high powered electric lights along two or three blocks on main street the dauntless confessed white way is installed town lit up like broadway speech by hon james blausser
come on you twin cities our hat is in the ring
a red headed young man who smoked cigarettes in a long amber holder carol read the booklet with a certain wonder
she learned that plover and minniemashie lakes were world famed for their beauteous wooded shores and gamey pike and bass not to be equalled elsewhere in the entire country that the residences of gopher prairie were models
of dignity comfort and culture with lawns and gardens known far and wide that the gopher prairie schools and public library in its neat and commodious building were celebrated throughout the state that the gopher prairie mills made the
best flour in the country that the surrounding farm lands were renowned
and that the stores in gopher prairie compared favorably with minneapolis and chicago in their abundance of luxuries and necessities and the ever courteous attention of the skilled clerks she learned in brief
that this was the one logical location for factories and wholesale houses
kennicott was triumphant when the commercial club did capture one small shy factory which planned to make wooden automobile wheels but when carol saw the promoter
she could not feel that his coming much mattered and a year after when he failed she could not be very sorrowful
but carol could discover no more pictures nor interesting food nor gracious voices nor amusing conversation nor questing minds she could she asserted endure a shabby but modest town
the town shabby and egomaniac she could not endure she could nurse champ perry and warm to the neighborliness of sam clark but she could not sit applauding honest jim blausser
though the armistice with germany was signed a few weeks after her coming to washington the work of the bureau continued she filed correspondence all day then she dictated answers to letters of inquiry it was an endurance of monotonous details
yet she asserted that she had found real work disillusions she did have she discovered that in the afternoon office routine stretches to the grave she discovered that an office is as full of cliques and scandals as a gopher prairie
a free sunday it did not appear that the great world needed her inspiration but she felt that her letters her contact with the anxieties of men and women all over the country were a part of vast affairs
not confined to main street and a kitchen but linked with paris bangkok madrid she perceived that she could do office work without losing any of the putative feminine virtue of domesticity that cooking and cleaning
not to have to report to kennicott at the end of the day all that she had done or might do was a relief which made up for the office weariness she felt that she was no longer one half of a marriage
white columns seen across leafy parks spacious avenues twisty alleys daily she passed a dark square house with a hint of magnolias and a courtyard behind it and a tall curtained second story window through which a woman was always peering
the woman was mystery romance a story which told itself differently every day now she was a murderess now the neglected wife of an ambassador it was mystery which carol had most lacked in gopher prairie
where every house was open to view where every person was but too easy to meet where there were no secret gates opening upon moors over which one might walk by moss deadened paths to strange high adventures in an ancient garden
as she flitted up sixteenth street after a kreisler recital given late in the afternoon for the government clerks as the lamps kindled in spheres of soft fire as the breeze flowed into the street fresh as prairie winds and kindlier
as she glanced up the elm alley of massachusetts avenue as she was rested by the integrity of the scottish rite temple she loved the city as she loved no one save hugh she encountered negro shanties turned into studios
with orange curtains and pots of mignonette marble houses on new hampshire avenue with butlers and limousines and men who looked like fictional explorers and aviators her days were swift and she knew that in her folly of running away
were the members of the tincomb methodist church a vast red brick tabernacle vida sherwin had given her a letter to an earnest woman with eye glasses plaid silk waist and a belief in bible classes who introduced her to the pastor and the
they went to sunday service sunday school christian endeavor missionary lectures church suppers precisely as they had at home they agreed that ambassadors and flippant newspapermen and infidel scientists of the bureaus
were equally wicked and to be avoided and by cleaving to tincomb church they kept their ideals from all contamination they welcomed carol asked about her husband gave her advice regarding colic in babies
passed her the gingerbread and scalloped potatoes at church suppers and in general made her very unhappy and lonely so that she wondered if she might not enlist in the militant suffrage organization and be allowed to go to jail
always she was to perceive in washington as doubtless she would have perceived in new york or london a thick streak of main street the cautious dullness of a gopher prairie appeared in boarding houses where ladylike bureau clerks
about nothing in particular the captain introduced her to the secretary of a congressman a cynical young widow with many acquaintances in the navy through her carol met commanders and majors newspapermen
chemists and geographers and fiscal experts from the bureaus and a teacher who was a familiar of the militant suffrage headquarters the teacher took her to headquarters carol never became a prominent suffragist
indeed her only recognized position was as an able addresser of envelopes but she was casually adopted by this family of friendly women who when they were not being mobbed or arrested took dancing lessons or went picnicking up the chesapeake canal
though it absorbed most of her salary an excellent nurse for hugh she herself put him to bed and played with him on holidays there were walks with him there were motionless evenings of reading but chiefly washington was associated with people
scores of them sitting about the flat talking talking talking not always wisely but always excitedly it was not at all the artist's studio of which because of its persistence in fiction she had dreamed
but they played very simply and they saw no reason why anything which exists cannot also be acknowledged she was sometimes shocked quite as she had shocked gopher prairie by these girls with their cigarettes and elfish knowledge
the presence of hugh made her feel temporary some day oh she'd have to take him back to open fields and the right to climb about hay lofts but the fact that she could never be eminent among these scoffing enthusiasts
did not keep her from being proud of them from defending them in imaginary conversations with kennicott who grunted she could hear his voice they're simply a bunch of wild impractical theorists sittin round chewing the rag and
the acceptance of women without embarrassed banter for which she had longed in gopher prairie yet they seemed to be as efficient as the sam clarks she concluded that it was because they were of secure reputation not hemmed in by the fire of provincial jealousies
kennicott had asserted that the villager's lack of courtesy is due to his poverty we're no millionaire dudes he boasted yet these army and navy men these bureau experts and organizers of multitudinous leagues
that institution is reserved for men like kennicott who after devoting fifty years to putting aside a stake incontinently invest the stake in spurious oil stocks
she found the same faith not only in girls escaped from domesticity but also in demure old ladies who tragically deprived of esteemed husbands and huge old houses
yet managed to make a very comfortable thing of it by living in small flats and having time to read but she also learned that by comparison gopher prairie was a model of daring color clever planning and frenzied intellectuality
from her teacher housemate she had a sardonic description of a middlewestern railroad division town of the same size as gopher prairie but devoid of lawns and trees a town where the tracks sprawled along the cinder scabbed main street and the railroad shops
dripping soot from eaves and doorway rolled out smoke in greasy coils other towns she came to know by anecdote a prairie village where the wind blew all day long and the mud was two feet thick in spring and in summer
new england mill towns with the hands living in rows of cottages like blocks of lava a rich farming center in new jersey off the railroad furiously pious ruled by old men unbelievably ignorant old men
sitting about the grocery talking of james g blaine a southern town full of the magnolias and white columns which carol had accepted as proof of romance but hating the negroes obsequious to the old families
a western mining settlement like a tumor a booming semi city with parks and clever architects visited by famous pianists and unctuous lecturers but irritable from a struggle between union labor and the manufacturers association
the lines are broken and uncertain of direction often instead of rising they sink in wavering scrawls and the colors are watery blue and pink and the dim gray of rubbed pencil marks a few lines are traceable
unhappy women are given to protecting their sensitiveness by cynical gossip by whining by high church and new thought religions or by a fog of vagueness carol had hidden in none of these refuges from reality
but she who was tender and merry had been made timorous by gopher prairie even her flight had been but the temporary courage of panic the thing she gained in washington was not information about office systems and labor unions but renewed courage
that amiable contempt called poise her glimpse of tasks involving millions of people and a score of nations reduced main street from bloated importance to its actual pettiness she could never again be quite so awed by the power
she caught something of an impersonal attitude saw that she had been as touchily personal as maud dyer and why she began to ask did she rage at individuals not individuals but institutions are the enemies
and they most afflict the disciples who the most generously serve them
chapter seven johnny chuck joins the class
peter rabbit delivered mother nature's message to johnny chuck johnny didn't seem at all pleased he grumbled and growled to himself he didn't want to go to school he didn't want to learn anything about his relatives
he was perfectly satisfied with things as they were the truth is johnny chuck was already beginning to get fat with good living and he is naturally lazy as a rule he can find plenty to eat very near his home
so he seldom goes far from his own doorstep peter left him grumbling and growling and chuckled to himself all the way back to the dear old briar patch he knew that johnny chuck would not dare disobey old mother nature
sure enough the next morning johnny chuck came waddling through the green forest just as old mother nature was about to open school he didn't look at all happy and he didn't reply at all to the greetings of the others
it wasn't for your benefit that i sent word for you to be here this morning it was for the benefit of your friends and neighbors now sit up so that all can get a good look at you
one should call them this is more than i can understand belong to the marmot branch of the squirrel family and wherever found they look much alike as you will notice johnny chuck's coat is brownish yellow
his feet are very dark brown almost black his head is dark brown with light gray on his cheeks beneath he is reddish orange including his throat his tail is short for a member of the squirrel family
he has a number of whiskers and they are black some woodchucks are quite gray and occasionally there is one who is almost or wholly black just as there are black gray squirrels
johnny here is not fond of the green forest but loves the old orchard and the green meadows in some parts of the country there are members of his family who prefer to live just on the edge of the green forest you will notice that johnny has stout claws
i can climb if i have to retorted johnny chuck indignantly i've climbed up bushes and low trees lots of times and if i can get a good run first i can climb up the straight trunk of a tree with rough bark to the first branches if they are not too far above ground
johnny chuck certainly is right at home when it comes to digging you ought to be thankful that he is said old mother nature for the holes he has dug have saved your life more than once by the way peter since you are so well acquainted with those holes
peter was delighted to air his knowledge the last one i was in said he was a long tunnel slanting down for quite a distance and then straightening out the entrance was quite large with a big heap of sand out in front of it
down a little way the tunnel grew smaller and then remained the same size all the rest of the way way down at the farther end was a nice little bedroom with some grass in it there were one or two other little rooms
and there were two branch tunnels leading up to the surface of the ground making side or back doorways there was no sand around either of these and they were quite hidden by the long grass hanging over them
those back doorways are very handy in time of danger do you always have three doorways asked happy jack
and once in a while only one but that isn't really safe
sometimes however if we cannot find a place that just suits us we go quite a distance are your babies born down in that little bedroom in the ground asked jumper the hare of course replied johnny chuck
no replied johnny chuck give me green food every time there is nothing so good as tender sweet clover and young grass unless it be some of those fine vegetables farmer brown grows in his garden
i am as thin as i was fat in the fall this is because i have used up the fat waiting for the first green things to appear do you have many enemies asked peter rabbit who has so many himself that he is constantly thinking of them
i am afraid of shadow the weasel reddy fox has tried to dig me out more than once but i can dig faster than he can if he ever gets me cornered he'll find that i can fight
time is up interrupted old mother nature
and on the prairies of the great west he has a smaller cousin named
and to morrow i'll tell you about them if you want me to
johnny chuck hung his head for he was a little ashamed that he had been so unwilling to come that morning if you please mother nature said he i think i'll come i didn't know i had any close relatives and i want to know about them
danglars signature the next morning dawned dull and cloudy during the night the undertakers had executed their melancholy office and wrapped the corpse in the winding sheet
which whatever may be said about the equality of death is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in life this winding sheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of cambric
he sleeps indeed and this is the more strange since the least contradiction keeps him awake all night
and they both returned thoughtfully to the procureur's study
grief does not stun me i have not been in bed for two nights but then look at my desk see what i have written during these two days and nights i have filled those papers and have made out the accusation against the assassin benedetto
oh work work my passion my joy my delight it is for thee to alleviate my sorrows
no said villefort only return again at eleven o'clock at twelve the the oh heavens my poor poor child and the procureur again becoming a man lifted up his eyes and groaned
shall you be present in the reception room no i have a cousin who has undertaken this sad office i shall work doctor
everything and indeed no sooner had the doctor left the room than he was again absorbed in study
a personage as insignificant in our story as in the world he occupied one of those beings designed from their birth to make themselves useful to others he was punctual dressed in black with crape around his hat
and presented himself at his cousin's with a face made up for the occasion and which he could alter as might be required at twelve o'clock the mourning coaches rolled into the paved court
equally pleased to witness the festivities or the mourning of the rich and who rush with the same avidity to a funeral procession as to the marriage of a duchess gradually the reception room filled
and some of our old friends made their appearance we mean debray
accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar in literature or the army
less owing to his social position than to his personal merit the cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests and it was rather a relief to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as themselves
and who did not exact a mournful face or force tears as would have been the case with a father a brother or a lover
one of them was made of debray chateau renaud and beauchamp poor girl said debray like the rest paying an involuntary tribute to the sad event poor girl
so young so rich so beautiful could you have imagined this scene chateau renaud when we saw her at the most three weeks ago about to sign that contract indeed no said chateau renaud did you know her
the day with the wife of the worthy gentleman who is receiving us who is he
the gentleman who receives us is he a deputy oh no i am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day said beauchamp but he is perfectly unknown to me have you mentioned this death in your paper
it has been mentioned but the article is not mine
he would have interested himself somewhat more about it still said chateau renaud
but whom are you seeking debray i am seeking the count of monte cristo said the young man
his banker danglars is his banker is he not asked chateau renaud of debray i believe so replied the secretary with slight uneasiness but monte cristo is not the only one i miss here i do not see morrel
still he ought to have been here said debray i wonder what will be talked about to night this funeral is the news of the day but hush here comes our minister of justice
and advanced to meet him with a sad though affable smile well said he extending his hand to monte cristo
for indeed misfortune has taken possession of my house when i perceived you i was just asking myself whether i had not wished harm towards those poor morcerfs which would have justified the proverb of
he who wishes misfortunes to happen to others experiences them himself well on my word of honor i answered no i wished no ill to morcerf he was a little proud perhaps for a man who like myself has risen from nothing
but we all have our faults do you know count that persons of our time of life not that you belong to the class you are still a young man but as i was saying persons of our time of life have been very unfortunate this year
for example look at the puritanical procureur who has just lost his daughter and in fact nearly all his family in so singular a manner morcerf dishonored and dead
and then myself covered with ridicule through the villany of benedetto besides besides what asked the count alas do you not know what new calamity my daughter
eugenie has left us good heavens what are you telling me the truth my dear count oh how happy you must be in not having either wife or children do you think so indeed i do
she could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch so she asked permission to travel and is she gone the other night she left
no with a relation but still we have quite lost our dear eugenie for i doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to france still baron said monte cristo
family griefs or indeed any other affliction which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure are endurable to a millionaire philosophers may well say and practical men will always support the opinion
that money mitigates many trials and if you admit the efficacy of this sovereign balm you ought to be very easily consoled you the king of finance the focus of immeasurable power
as though to ascertain whether he spoke seriously yes he answered if a fortune brings consolation i ought to be consoled i am rich
if you wished to demolish them you could not and if it were possible you would not dare
that reminds me he said that when you entered i was on the point of signing five little bonds i have already signed two will you allow me to do the same to the others pray do so
there was a moment's silence during which the noise of the banker's pen was alone heard while monte cristo examined the gilt mouldings on the ceiling are they spanish haitian
or neapolitan bonds said monte cristo no said danglars smiling
stay count he added you who may be called the emperor if i claim the title of king of finance have you many pieces of paper of this size each worth a million
to the governor of the bank please pay to my order from the fund deposited by me the sum of a million and charge the same to my account baron danglars
one two three four five said monte cristo five millions why what a croesus you are this is how i transact business said danglars it is really wonderful said the count above all
it is indeed said danglars it is a fine thing to have such credit really it is only in france these things are done five millions on five little scraps of paper it must be seen to be believed
no said monte cristo folding the five notes most decidedly not the thing is so curious i will make the experiment myself i am credited on you for six millions i have drawn nine hundred thousand francs
you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand francs i will take the five scraps of paper that i now hold as bonds with your signature alone and here is a receipt in full for the six millions between us
and monte cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one hand
if a thunderbolt had fallen at the banker's feet
what he stammered do you mean to keep that money excuse me excuse me but i owe this money to the charity fund a deposit which i promised to pay this morning oh well then said monte cristo
pay me in a different form i wished from curiosity to take these that i might be able to say that without any advice or preparation the house of danglars had paid me five millions without a minute's delay it would have been remarkable but here are your bonds pay me differently
that is being wrested from its grasp suddenly he rallied made a violent effort to restrain himself and then a smile gradually widened the features of his disturbed countenance certainly he said your receipt is money
oh dear yes and if you were at rome the house of thomson and french would make no more difficulty about paying the money on my receipt than you have just done pardon me count pardon me then i may keep this money yes said danglars
while the perspiration started from the roots of his hair yes keep it keep it monte cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable expression which seemed to say come reflect if you repent there is still time
no decidedly no keep my signatures but you know none are so formal as bankers in transacting business i intended this money for the charity fund and i seemed to be robbing them if i did not pay them with these precise bonds how absurd
as if one crown were not as good as another excuse me and he began to laugh loudly but nervously certainly i excuse you said monte cristo graciously and pocket them and he placed the bonds in his pocket book but
there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs oh a mere nothing said monte cristo the balance would come to about that sum but keep it and we shall be quits count said danglars are you speaking seriously
i never joke with bankers said monte cristo in a freezing manner which repelled impertinence
i think i arrived just in time to obtain your signatures or they would have been disputed with me
who was standing in the waiting room and who was introduced into danglars room as soon as the count had left the count's sad face was illumined by a faint smile as he noticed the portfolio which the receiver general held in his hand
at the door he found his carriage and was immediately driven to the bank
we need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his lips good morning creditor said he for i wager anything it is the creditor who visits me
the charities present themselves to you through me the widows and orphans depute me to receive alms to the amount of five millions from you
but did you receive my letter yesterday yes i have brought my receipt
you did see him i think yes well
how so the count has an unlimited credit upon me a credit opened by thomson and french of rome he came to demand five millions at once which i paid him with checks on the bank my funds are deposited there and you can understand
that if i draw out ten millions on the same day it will appear rather strange to the governor two days will be a different thing said danglars smiling come said boville with a tone of entire incredulity five millions to that gentleman who just left
and who bowed to me as though he knew me
five millions here is his receipt believe your own eyes
it is one of the best houses in europe said danglars carelessly throwing down the receipt on his desk and he had five millions in your hands alone why this count of monte cristo must be a nabob indeed i do not know what he is
he has three unlimited credits one on me one on rothschild one on lafitte and you see he added carelessly he has given me the preference by leaving a balance of one hundred thousand francs
i must visit him he said and obtain some pious grant from him oh you may make sure of him his charities alone amount to twenty thousand francs a month it is magnificent
i will set before him the example of madame de morcerf and her son what example they gave all their fortune to the hospitals what fortune their own
for what reason because they would not spend money so guiltily acquired
upon the mother retires into the country and the son enters the army well i must confess these are scruples i registered their deed of gift yesterday and how much did they possess oh not much
from twelve to thirteen hundred thousand francs but to return to our millions
are you then pressed for this money yes for the examination of our cash takes place to morrow to morrow why did you not tell me so before why it is as good as a century at what hour does the examination take place at two o'clock
now i think of it you can do better said danglars how do you mean
take it to rothschild's or lafitte's and they will take it off your hands at once
certainly it will only cost you a discount of five thousand or six thousand francs the receiver started back ma foi he said i prefer waiting till to morrow what a proposition
that you had a deficiency to make up indeed said the receiver and if that were the case it would be worth while to make some sacrifice thank you no sir then it will be to morrow yes but without fail
ah you are laughing at me send to morrow at twelve and the bank shall be notified i will come myself better still since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you they shook hands
no said the banker i have appeared rather ridiculous since that affair of benedetto so i remain in the background bah you are wrong how were you to blame in that affair
listen when one bears an irreproachable name as i do one is rather sensitive
they are gone to seek a very strict convent in italy or spain
after expressing acute sympathy with the father
with an energy of action those can alone understand
fool then enclosing monte cristo's receipt in a little pocket book he added yes come at twelve o'clock i shall then be far away then he double locked his door emptied all his drawers collected about fifty thousand francs in bank notes
burned several papers left others exposed to view
a fathom deep in sleep i lie with old desires restrained before to clamor lifeward with a cry as dark flies out the greying door and so in quest of creeds to share i seek assertive day again
but old monotony is there endless avenues of rain oh might i rise again might i throw off the heat of that old wine see the new morning mass the sky with fairy towers line on line
the air became gray and opalescent a solitary light suddenly outlined a window over the way then another light then a hundred more danced and glimmered into vision under his feet a thick iron studded skylight turned yellow
in the street the lamps of the taxi cabs sent out glistening sheens along the already black pavement the unwelcome november rain had perversely stolen the day's last hour and pawned it with that ancient fence the night
the silence of the theatre behind him ended with a curious snapping sound followed by the heavy roaring of a rising crowd and the interlaced clatter of many voices the matinee was over
he stood aside edged a little into the rain to let the throng pass a small boy rushed out sniffed in the damp fresh air and turned up the collar of his coat came three or four couples in a great hurry
came a further scattering of people whose eyes as they emerged glanced invariably first at the wet street then at the rain filled air finally at the dismal sky last a dense strolling mass
that depressed him with its heavy odor compounded of the tobacco smell of the men and the fetid sensuousness of stale powder on women after the thick crowd came another scattering a stray half dozen a man on crutches
finally the rattling bang of folding seats inside announced that the ushers were at work new york seemed not so much awakening as turning over in its bed pallid men rushed by pinching together their coat collars
a great swarm of tired magpie girls from a department store crowded along with shrieks of strident laughter three to an umbrella a squad of marching policemen passed already miraculously protected by oilskin capes the rain gave amory a feeling of detachment
and the numerous unpleasant aspects of city life without money occurred to him in threatening procession there was the ghastly stinking crush of the subway the car cards thrusting themselves at one leering out like dull bores who grab your arm with another story
the querulous worry as to whether some one isn't leaning on you a man deciding not to give his seat to a woman hating her for it the woman hating him for not doing it at worst a squalid phantasmagoria of breath
at best just people too hot or too cold tired worried he pictured the rooms where these people lived where the patterns of the blistered wall papers were heavy reiterated sunflowers on green and yellow backgrounds
and always there was the economical stuffiness of indoor winter and the long summers nightmares of perspiration between sticky enveloping walls dirty restaurants where careless tired people helped themselves to sugar with their own used coffee spoons
leaving hard brown deposits in the bowl it was not so bad where there were only men or else only women it was when they were vilely herded that it all seemed so rotten it was some shame that women gave off at having men see them tired and poor
it was some disgust that men had for women who were tired and poor it was dirtier than any battle field he had seen
and danger it was an atmosphere wherein birth and marriage and death were loathsome secret things he remembered one day in the subway when a delivery boy had brought in a great funeral wreath of fresh flowers
how the smell of it had suddenly cleared the air and given every one in the car a momentary glow i detest poor people thought amory suddenly i hate them for being poor poverty may have been beautiful once but it's rotten now
and saying something to his companion with a look of utter disgust probably thought amory what he said was my god aren't people horrible never before in his life had amory considered poor people
he thought cynically how completely he was lacking in all human sympathy o henry had found in these people romance pathos love hate amory saw only coarseness physical filth and stupidity he made no self accusations
never any more did he reproach himself for feelings that were natural and sincere he accepted all his reactions as a part of him unchangeable unmoral this problem of poverty transformed magnified attached to some grander
more dignified attitude might some day even be his problem at present it roused only his profound distaste he walked over to fifth avenue dodging the blind black menace of umbrellas and standing in front of delmonico's hailed an auto bus
somewhere in his mind a conversation began rather resumed its place in his attention it was composed not of two voices but of one which acted alike as questioner and answerer question well what's the situation answer
that i have about twenty four dollars to my name question
i can't imagine not being able to
really they are the only things i can do question be definite
i don't know what i'll do nor have i much curiosity to morrow i'm going to leave new york for good it's a bad town unless you're on top of it question do you want a lot of money a
no i am merely afraid of being poor question very afraid
just passively afraid question
don't ask me question don't you care
rather i don't want to commit moral suicide question have you no interests left
none i've no more virtue to lose just as a cooling pot gives off heat so all through youth and adolescence we give off calories of virtue that's what's called ingenuousness question an interesting idea
that's why a good man going wrong attracts people they stand around and literally warm themselves at the calories of virtue he gives off sarah makes an unsophisticated remark and the faces simper in delight how innocent the poor child is
they're warming themselves at her virtue but sarah sees the simper and never makes that remark again only she feels a little colder after that question all your calories gone
all of them i'm beginning to warm myself at other people's virtue question are you corrupt
i think so i'm not sure i'm not sure about good and evil at all any more question is that a bad sign in itself
not necessarily question what would be the test of corruption
becoming really insincere calling myself not such a bad fellow thinking i regretted my lost youth when i only envy the delights of losing it
they don't they just want the fun of eating it all over again the matron doesn't want to repeat her girlhood she wants to repeat her honeymoon
this dialogue merged grotesquely into his mind's most familiar state a grotesque blending of desires worries exterior impressions and physical reactions one hundred and twenty seventh street or one hundred and thirty seventh street
two and three look alike no not much seat damp are clothes absorbing wetness from seat or seat absorbing dryness from clothes sitting on wet substance gave appendicitis so froggy parker's mother said well he'd had it
i'll sue the steamboat company beatrice said and my uncle has a quarter interest did beatrice go to heaven probably not he represented beatrice's immortality also love affairs of numerous dead men who surely had never thought of him
if it wasn't appendicitis influenza maybe what one hundred and twentieth street
one o two instead of one two seven rosalind not like beatrice eleanor like beatrice only wilder and brainier apartments along here expensive probably hundred and fifty a month maybe two hundred
uncle had only paid hundred a month for whole great big house in minneapolis question were the stairs on the left or right as you came in anyway in twelve univee they were straight back and to the left what a dirty river
want to go down there and see if it's dirty french rivers all brown or black so were southern rivers twenty four dollars meant four hundred and eighty doughnuts he could live on it three months and sleep in the park wonder where jill was jill bayne fayne
sayne what the devil neck hurts darned uncomfortable seat no desire to sleep with jill what could alec see in her
own taste the best isabelle clara rosalind eleanor were all american eleanor would pitch probably southpaw rosalind was outfield wonderful hitter clara first base maybe
wonder what humbird's body looked like now if he himself hadn't been bayonet instructor he'd have gone up to line three months sooner probably been killed where's the darned bell
and a crane let them down to the conical top of the projectile there an opening made for the purpose gave them access to the aluminum car the tackle belonging to the crane being hauled from outside
nicholl once introduced with his companions inside the projectile began to close the opening by means of a strong plate held in position by powerful screws other plates closely fitted
covered the lenticular glasses and the travelers hermetically enclosed in their metal prison were plunged in profound darkness and now my dear companions said michel ardan
gas was not invented for moles so saying the thoughtless fellow lit a match by striking it on the sole of his boot and approached the burner fixed to the receptacle in which the carbonized hydrogen
stored at high pressure sufficed for the lighting and warming of the projectile for a hundred and forty four hours or six days and six nights the gas caught fire
and thus lighted the projectile looked like a comfortable room with thickly padded walls furnished with a circular divan and a roof rounded in the shape of a dome michel ardan examined everything
you smile barbicane
do you say to yourself this prison may be our tomb tomb perhaps still i would not change it for mahomet's which floats in space but never advances an inch
while michel ardan was speaking barbicane and nicholl were making their last preparations nicholl's chronometer marked twenty minutes past ten p m when the three travelers were finally enclosed in their projectile
this chronometer was set within the tenth of a second by that of murchison the engineer barbicane consulted it my friends said he it is twenty minutes past ten at forty seven minutes past ten
murchison will launch the electric spark on the wire which communicates with the charge of the columbiad at that precise moment we shall leave our spheroid thus we still have twenty seven minutes to remain on the earth
well exclaimed michel ardan in a good humored tone much may be done in twenty six minutes
well twenty four if you like my noble captain said ardan twenty four minutes in which to investigate michel said barbicane during the passage we shall have plenty of time to investigate the most difficult questions
for the present we must occupy ourselves with our departure are we not ready doubtless but there are still some precautions to be taken to deaden as much as possible the first shock
have we not the water cushions placed between the partition breaks whose elasticity will sufficiently protect us i hope so michel replied barbicane gently but i am not sure
asked barbicane humph said michel ardan it is not easy we are in the train and the guard's whistle will sound before twenty four minutes are over twenty said nicholl
for some moments the three travelers looked at each other then they began to examine the objects imprisoned with them everything is in its place said barbicane
we have now to decide how we can best place ourselves to resist the shock position cannot be an indifferent matter and we must as much as possible prevent the rush of blood to the head
no said barbicane let us stretch ourselves on our sides we shall resist the shock better that way remember that when the projectile starts it matters little whether we are in it or before it
replied the captain we've still thirteen minutes and a half that nicholl is not a man exclaimed michel he is a chronometer with seconds an escape and eight holes
we might well ask ourselves of what materials are the hearts of these americans made to whom the approach of the most frightful danger added no pulsation
three thick and solidly made couches had been placed in the projectile nicholl and barbicane placed them in the center of the disc forming the floor
there the three travelers were to stretch themselves some moments before their departure during this time ardan not being able to keep still turned in his narrow prison like a wild beast in a cage
chatting with his friends speaking to the dogs diana and satellite to whom as may be seen he had given significant names ah diana ah satellite
he exclaimed teasing them so you are going to show the moon dogs the good habits of the dogs of the earth that will do honor to the canine race if ever we do come down again
i will bring a cross type of moon dogs which will make a stir if there are dogs in the moon said barbicane there are said michel ardan just as there are horses cows
donkeys and chickens i bet that we shall find chickens a hundred dollars we shall find none said nicholl done my captain replied ardan clasping nicholl's hand but by the bye
thirty seven minutes six seconds past ten it is understood captain well before another quarter of an hour you will have to count nine thousand dollars to the president
four thousand because the columbiad will not burst and five thousand because the projectile will rise more than six miles in the air
i only ask to be allowed to pay come nicholl i see that you are a man of method which i could never be but indeed you have made a series of bets of very little advantage to yourself allow me to tell you
and why asked nicholl because if you gain the first the columbiad will have burst and the projectile with it and barbicane will no longer be there to reimburse your dollars my stake is deposited at the bank in baltimore
replied barbicane simply and if nicholl is not there it will go to his heirs ah you practical men exclaimed michel ardan i admire you the more for not being able to understand you
at the bottom of a gun nine hundred feet long and under this projectile are rammed four hundred thousand pounds of gun cotton which is equal to one million six hundred thousand pounds of ordinary powder and friend murchison
his eye fixed on the needle his finger on the electric apparatus is counting the seconds preparatory to launching us into interplanetary space enough michel enough
said barbicane in a serious voice let us prepare
one clasp of the hand my friends yes exclaimed michel ardan more moved than he wished to appear and the three bold companions were united in a last embrace god preserve us
barbicane quickly put out the gas and lay down by his companions and the profound silence was only broken by the ticking of the chronometer marking the seconds
sustains the shortest lived human beings of our universe it is seldom that any of the creatures reach more than four years of age according to our standards of time
they are nearly as large as we and relatively much lighter in weight all the periods of physical growth are correspondingly decreased children walk four or five weeks after birth
and are capable of receiving regular instruction at the age of five months strange as it may seem this sphere which for convenience we will call brief
revolves very slowly on its axis so that our world makes fifteen times as many revolutions as this planet it requires but little arithmetic to figure out that the people of brief do not see the sun rise very often
on this world of brief all vegetables mature in periods so short that one marvels when he hears it think of cereals reaching maturity in seven or eight of our days or during one day of brief
early in the morning certain crops are planted and are harvested at night two or more days are required for maturing other crops actually the people of brief raise their crops with less labor than is required amongst us
if you were permitted to look upon the public and private life of this incredible world your first sensation would be dizziness not to mention the weirdness of all sights that would confront you at every turn
and if by lease of strength they pass on toward an age of four years it is but an evidence of their exceptional vitality it seems to be true that the experiences of a long life of sixty or eighty years is crowded into a narrow compass of four years
there being no competition no time or space is required for sensational trash thus if nothing of importance occurs nothing need be transmitted the official news censors decide as to the relative importance of occurrences
there need not be a certain amount of news telegraphed each hour the government verifies as much as possible all reports before they are transmitted there are indeed some advantages in the government being in constant touch with each home under its care
the advertising department pays nearly all expenses of this whole system of journalism announcements for private gain are paid at a regular rate it costs more to advertise at certain periods than at other times
they never think of covering the feet under any change of climate if one of the briefites were to step upon the shores of our rugged earth and see the cotton or wool and leather that lies around our feet it would appear to him as the most ridiculous thing imaginable
neither the men women nor children seem to seek this means for self beautifying they seem to think that beauty of character has a radiance more to be desired than the flash of opals or the luster of silks their garments partake of the loose flowing order
for instance a strong fabric of chosen shade is fastened at the neck hip knee and ankle and lies carelessly over the parts between the females never graduated to the corset degree and while they do not cut a scientific figure
transportation the methods of traveling are so contrary to our conceptions and practices that i almost forbear to attempt any description
when an exchange of seats is necessary it is all done so easily and so quickly that you would wonder why we tolerate trolley cars in traveling from city to city a system is in use that i will call the toboggan slide system
although the cars run on wheels the car is raised in a shaft about one hundred feet and then by gravity it dashes two or more miles according to the lay of the land traversed then another rise more or less than one hundred feet is experienced
and then another wild dash i have no words of praise for this system although the briefites can cover considerable territory in an hour they look upon this gravity system as a wonderful achievement for it has not been in operation for more than three hundred years
the power of steam has never been utilized no genius of all this active world of brief ever conceived the idea that almost unlimited power lies wrapped up in thin vapory water but they have discovered what we would call gaseous oil
and have learned to put it to work so that it is the main force employed in hoisting and all other purposes where power is required nothing like a traveling locomotive has ever been made although i learned that a bright wizard was experimenting
and that he prophesied great changes when his gas propelled vehicle was perfected think of how much value an ordinary citizen of our world would be to these briefites if he could step upon their world and communicate with them concerning the magic wonders of steam
and the manner of constructing stationary and movable engines to say nothing of the hidden wonders of electricity quadrupeds that take the place of our horses are used for drayage although nothing except the two wheeled class of vehicles was ever used until some eighty seven years ago
public highways these interesting people excel us in their style and manner of home building fencing and making public highways we are heathenish in our progress along the line of road making especially
in all my vast journey among the worlds i found only a few comparatively whereon the roads were inferior to ours in the world of brief the state prescribes the manner of public highways and each citizen must contribute his share to their creation and maintenance
very intricate and elaborate problems are solved by these people of a few years they are inferior to us in a hundred ways in the broad fields of manufacture and invention they lag a long distance in the rear this is principally due to their lack of time
religious life the religious life of the people of brief is on an average of a higher type than is found in our world their belief in immortality has run parallel with their existence as a people
the most faithful translation of this word into our language would be god affluence kerm cher or god breath appeared upon brief full grown
similar to christ he confirmed his identity by unanswerable miracles many however disbelieved in kerm cher and held to the old axiomatic truths thus creeds were prevalent and they remain until now
only there is much less variety than is found amongst us kerm cher set up a new reign and accepted a temporal throne for a season he finally announced that his ambassadorship would soon cease
and that his followers would lose the throne of civil power that they would be tested for a season in the valley of humiliation and by the fires of terrible persecution and that they who would endure unto the end would be glorified
moisture from the night's rain hung on the tree leaves clung in globules to rynch's sweating body he lay on a wide branch trying to control the heavy panting which supplied his laboring lungs
and he could still hear the echoes of the startled cries which had come from the men who had threaded through the woods to the up pointed tail fins of the l b now he tried to reason why he had run they were his own kind
they would take him out of the loneliness of a world heretofore empty of his species but that tall man the one who had led the party into the irregular clearing about the life boat rynch shivered
dug his nails into the wood on which he lay at the sight of that man dream and reality had crashed together sending him into panic stricken flight that was the man from the room
the man with the cup as his heart quieted he began to think more coherently first he had not been able to find the strong jaws's den
then the marks on the ground at the point from which he had fallen and the l b were here just as he remembered but not far from the small ship he had discovered something more a campsite with a shelter fashioned out of spalls and vines
to go back to the ship clearing was to risk capture but he had to know rynch looked with more attention at his present surroundings deep mold under the trees here would hold tracks there might just be another way to move
though it was balled in upon itself he was sure the creature was fully as large as he and the menacing claws suggested it was a formidable opponent when it made no move to follow him
rynch began to hope it had only been defending its own hiding place for its present attitude suggested concealment still facing that featureless blob in the tree the man retreated alert for the first sign of advance on the part of the creature above
none came and he dared to slip around the bole of the tree under which he stood listening intently for any corresponding movement overhead now he was facing that survivor's camp
another object crouched in the dark of the lean to shelter just as its fellow was on sentry duty in the tree only this one did not have the self color of the foliage to disguise it four limbed its long forearms curved about its bent knees
and the sense organs of eyes and nose squeezed together on the lower quarter of the rounded portion with a line of wide mouth to split the blunt round of the muzzle dark pits for eyes showed no pupil iris or cornea
the nose was a black perfectly rounded tube jutting an inch or so beyond the cheek surface grotesque alien and terrifying it made no hostile move and since it had not turned its head he could not be sure it had even sighted him
but it knew he was there he was certain of that and was waiting for what as the long seconds crawled by rynch began to believe that it was not waiting for him heartened he pulled at the vine loop
climbed back into the tree minutes later he discovered that there were more than two of the beasts waiting quietly about the camp and that their sentry line ran between him and the clearing of the l b he withdrew farther into the wood
intent upon finding a detour which would bring him out into the open lands now he wanted to join forces with his own kind whether those men were potential enemies or not as time passed the beasts closed about the clearing of the camp
afternoon was fading into evening when he reached a point several miles downstream near the river since he had come into the open he had not sighted any of the watchers he hoped they did not willingly venture out of the trees where the leaves were their protection
rynch went flat on the stream bank made a worm's progress up the slope to crouch behind a bush and survey the land immediately ahead there stood an off world spacer fins down nose skyward
and grouped not too far from its landing ramp a collection of bubble tents a fire burned in their midst and men were moving about it now that he was free from the wood and its watchers and had come so near to his goal
rynch was curiously reluctant to do the sensible thing to rise out of concealment and walk up to that fire to claim rescue by his own kind the man he sought stood by the fire
shrugging his arms into a webbing harness which brought a box against his chest having made that fast he picked up a needler by its sling by their gestures the others were arguing with him but he shook his head came on
that idea made sense and in the meantime he would let the other past him follow along behind until he was far enough from the camp so that his friends could not interfere then they would have a meeting
in spite of his caution rynch was close to betrayal as he edged around a clump of vegetation growing half in half out of the stream only a timely rustle told him that the other had sat down on a drift log waiting for him rynch froze
so startled that he could not think clearly for a second then he noted that the outline of the other's body was visible growing brighter by the moment minute particles of pale greenish radiance were gathering about the other the dark shadow of an arm flapped the radiance swirled
but they no longer gathered in strength enough to light his presence now he could see they drifted about the vegetation about the log where the man sat about rocks and reeds only they were thicker about the stranger as if his body were a magnet
he continued to keep them whirling by means of waving hand and arm but there was enough light to show rynch the fingers of his other hand busy on the front panel of the box he wore that fingering stopped then rynch's head came up as he heard a very faint sound
not a beast's cry or was it again those fingers moved on the panel was the other sending a message by that means rynch watched him check the webbing count the equipment at his belt settle the needler in the crook of his arm
however the other was as wary of that dark as if he suspected what might lie in wait there he angled along northward avoiding clumps of scattered brush keeping in the open where rynch dared not tail him too closely
their course parallel to the woods brought them at last to a second stream the size of a river into which the first creek emptied here the other settled down between two rocks with every indication of remaining there for a period
thankfully rynch found his own lurking place from which he could keep the other in sight the light points gathered hung in a small luminous cloud over the rocks but rynch had prudently withdrawn under a bush
and the scent of its aromatic leaves must have discouraged the sparks for no such crown came to his sentry post drugged with fatigue the younger man slept awaking to full day a fog of bewilderment
what was the purpose of the other's expedition was he going to use the open cut through which the river ran as a way of penetrating the wooded country now rynch considered the problem from his own angle the man from the spacer had made no effort to conceal his trail
in fact it would almost seem that he had deliberately gone out of his way to leave boot prints on favorable stretches of ground did he guess that rynch lurked behind was now leading him on for some purpose of his own
or were those traces left to guide another party from the camp to advance openly up the stream bed was to invite discovery rynch surveyed the nearer bank clumps of small trees and high growing bushes dotted that expanse an ideal cover
that sound of snarling spitting hate ended in mid cry as rynch crawled to the river bank the man from the spacer camp had been the focus of a three prong attack from a female and her cubs
three red bodies were flat and still on the gravel as the off worlder leaned back against a rock breathing heavily as rynch sighted him he stooped to recover the needler he had dropped lurched away from the rock towards the water
clawed at the ground about him already he was buried to his knees then his mid thighs in the artificial quicksand but he had not lost his head and was jerking from side to side in an effort to pull free rynch got to his feet
walked with slow deliberation down to the river's brink the trapped prisoner had shied halfway around stretching out his arms to find a firmer grip on some rock large and heavy enough to anchor him after his first startled cry he had made no sound
but now as he sighted rynch his eyes widened and his lips parted the box on his chest caught on a stone he had dragged to him in a desperate try for support
there was a spitting of sparks and the stranger worked frantically at the buckle of the webbing harness to loosen it and toss the whole thing from him the box struck one of the dead water cats flashed as fur and flesh were singed
rynch watched dispassionately before he caught the needler jerking it away from the prisoner the man eyed him steadily and his expression did not alter even when rynch swung the off world weapon to center its sights on the late owner
suppose rynch's voice was rusty sounding in his own ears we talk now the man nodded
chapter twenty seven but we must follow edward for a time on his arrival at paris he was kindly received by king charles who promised to assist his views in joining the army
you have to choose between two generals both great in the art of war
and turenne i have no doubt that they will be opposed to each other soon that will be the better for you as you will learn tactics from such great players which would your majesty recommend me to follow inquired edward
and he will soon be opposed to this truculent and dishonest court who have kept me here as an instrument to accomplish their own wishes but who have never intended to keep their promises and place me on the english throne
i will give you letters to conde and recollect that whatever general you take service under you will follow him without pretending to calculate how far his movements may be right or wrong that is not your affair
conde is just now released from vincennes but depend upon it he will be in arms very soon as soon as he was furnished with the necessary credentials from the king edward presented himself at the levee of the prince of conde
you are here highly spoken of said the prince for so young a man so you were at the affair of worcester we will retain you for your services will be wanted by and by
can you procure any of your countrymen i know but of two that i can recommend from personal knowledge but these two officers i can venture to pledge myself for any more
bring me the officers to morrow at this hour monsieur beverley au revoir
edward went to chaloner and grenville who were delighted with the intelligence which he brought them the next day they were at the prince's levee and introduced by edward i am fortunate gentlemen
said the prince in securing the services of such fine young men you will oblige me by enlisting as many of your countrymen as you may consider likely to do good service and then follow me to guienne to which province i am now about to depart
and after my absence you will receive from them every assistance and necessary supplies which may be required a month after this interview conde who had been joined by a great number of nobles
and had been re enforced by troops from spain set up the standard of revolt edward and his friends joined them with about three hundred english and scotchmen which they had enlisted and very soon afterward
conde obtained the victory at blenan and in april sixteen fifty two advanced to paris turenne who had taken the command of the french army followed him
and a severe action was fought in the streets of the suburb of saint antoine in which neither party had the advantage
and not receiving the assistance he expected from the spaniards he fell back to the frontiers of champagne previous to his departure from paris edward had received humphrey's letter explaining away the intendant's conduct
and the contents removed a heavy load from edward's mind but he now thought of nothing but war and although he cherished the idea of patience heatherstone he was resolved to follow the fortunes of the prince as long as he could
he wrote a letter to the intendant thanking him for his kind feelings and intentions toward him and he trusted that he might one day have the pleasure of seeing him again he did not however think it advisable to mention the name of his daughter
except in inquiring after her health and sending his respects it may be years before i see her again thought edward and who knows what may happen
and edward with his friends followed his fortunes and gained his good will they were rapidly promoted time flew on and in the year sixteen fifty four the court of france concluded an alliance with cromwell
and expelled king charles from the french frontiers the war was still carried on in the netherlands turenne bore down conde who had gained every campaign and the court of spain wearied with reverses
made overtures of peace which was gladly accepted by the french during these wars cromwell had been named protector and had shortly afterward died
edward who but rarely heard from humphrey was now anxious to quit the army and go to the king who was in spain but to leave his colors while things were adverse was impossible
after the peace and the pardon of conde by the french king the armies were disbanded and the three adventurers were free they took their leave of the prince who thanked them for their long and meritorious services
and they then hastened to king charles who had left spain and come to the low countries at the time of their joining the king richard the son of cromwell who had been nominated protector had resigned and every thing was ready for the restoration
on the fifteenth of may sixteen sixty the news arrived that charles had been proclaimed king on the eighth and a large body of gentlemen went to invite him over the king sailed from scheveling
was met at dover by general monk and conducted to london which he entered amid the acclamations of the people on the twenty ninth of the same month we may leave the reader to suppose that edward
were among the most favored of those in his train as the procession moved slowly along the strand through a countless multitude the windows of all the houses were filled with well dressed ladies who waved their white kerchiefs to the king
and his attendant suit chaloner edward and grenville who rode side by side as gentlemen in waiting were certainly the most distinguished among the king's retinue look edward
at those lovely girls at yon window do you recognize them indeed i do not are they any of our paris beauties
they are thy sisters alice and edith
it is so i believe replied edward yes now that edith smiles i'm sure it is them yes replied grenville
will they think you recognize us we shall see replied edward
for while they had been speaking the procession had stopped is it possible thought edward that these can be the two girls in russet gowns that i left at the cottage and yet it must be
well chaloner to all appearance your good aunts have done justice to their charge nature has done more edward i never thought that they would have grown into such lovely girls as they have
although i always thought that they were handsome as they passed edward caught the eye of edith and smiled alice that's edward said edith so loud as to be heard by the king and all near him
alice and edith rose and waved their handkerchiefs but they were soon obliged to cease and put them to their eyes are those your sisters edward said the king they are your majesty
the king rose in his stirrups and made a low obeisance to the window where they were standing we shall have some court beauties beverley said the king looking at him over his shoulder as soon as the ceremonies were over
and they could escape from their personal attentions edward and his two friends went to the house in which resided the ladies conynghame and his sisters we pass over the joy of this meeting after so many years absence and the pleasure
which it gave to edward to find his sisters grown such accomplished and elegant young women that his two friends who were as the reader will recollect old acquaintances of alice and edith were warmly received we hardly need say
now edward who do you think was here to day the reigning belle and the toast of all the gentlemen indeed i must be careful of my heart dear edith who is she
no less than one with whom you were formerly well acquainted edward patience heatherstone patience heatherstone cried edward the toast of all london yes and deservedly so
i can assure you but she is as good as she is handsome and moreover treats all the gay gallants with perfect indifference she is staying with her uncle sir ashley cooper and her father is also in town
with her to day when did you hear from humphrey edith a few days back he has left the cottage now altogether indeed where does he reside then at arnwood the house has been rebuilt
and i understand is a very princely mansion humphrey has charge of it until it is ascertained to whom it is to belong it belongs to mister heatherstone does it not replied edward
how can you say so edward you received humphrey's letters a long while ago yes i did but let us not talk about it any more my dear edith i am in great perplexity
what is your perplexity well replied edward since it is to be so let us sit down and talk over the matter i acknowledge the kindness of mister heatherstone
and feel that all he asserted to humphrey is true still i do not like that i should be indebted to him for a property which is mine and that he has no right to give i acknowledge his generosity
but i do not acknowledge his right of possession nay much as i admire and i may say fond as i am for time has not effaced the feeling of his daughter it still appears to me that
although not said it is expected that she is to be included in the transfer and i will accept no wife on such conditions that is to say because all you wish for your property and a woman you love are offered you in one lot
you will not accept them they must be divided and handed over to you in two said alice smiling you mistake dearest i am not so foolish but i have a certain pride which you can not blame accepting the property from mister heatherstone
is receiving a favor were it given as a marriage portion with his daughter now why should i accept as a favor what i can claim as a right it is my intention of appealing to the king and demanding the restoration of my property
he can not refuse it put not your trust in princes brother replied alice i doubt if the king or his council will consider it advisable to make so many discontented
which has been so long held by others
recollect also that mister heatherstone and his brother in law sir ashley cooper have done the king much more service than you ever have or can do they have been most important agents in his restoration
and the king's obligations to them are much greater than they are to you besides merely for what may be called a point of honor for it is no more in what an unpleasant situation will you put his majesty
at all events edward recollect you do not know what are the intentions of mister heatherstone wait and see what he proffers first but my dear sister it appears to me that his intentions are evident
why has he rebuilt arnwood he is not going to surrender my property and make me a present of the house
you were at the wars it was possible that you might or might not return he said this to humphrey who has all along been acting as his factotum in the business and recollect at the time that mister heatherstone commenced the rebuilding of the mansion
what prospect was there of the restoration of the king or of your ever being in a position to apply for the restoration of your property i believe however that humphrey knows more of mister heatherstone's intentions than he has made known to us
and i therefore say again my dear edward make no application till you ascertain what mister heatherstone's intentions may be your advice is good my dear alice and i will be guided by it replied edward
and now let me give you some advice for your friends masters chaloner and grenville that much of their property has been taken away and put into other hands i know and probably they expect it will be restored upon their application to the king
those who hold the property think so too and so far it is fortunate now from wiser heads than mine
but at the same time if they were to meet the parties and close with them at once before the king's intentions are known they would recover their property at a third or a quarter of the value now is their time
even a few days delay may make a difference they can easily obtain a delay for the payment of the moneys impress that upon them my dear edward
and make the arrangements that is advice which must be followed replied edward we must go now and i will not fail to communicate it to them this very night we may as well here inform the reader
that the advice was immediately acted upon and that chaloner and grenville recovered all their estates at about five years purchase edward remained at court several days he had written to humphrey and had dispatched a messenger with the letter
but the messenger had not yet returned
on the following day a drawing room was to be held and edward's sisters were to be presented edward was standing with many others of the suit behind the chair of the king amusing himself with the presentations as they took place
and waiting for the arrival of his sisters chaloner and grenville were not with him they had obtained leave to go into the country for the object we have before referred to when his eyes caught advancing toward the king
mister heatherstone who led his daughter patience that they had not perceived him was evident indeed her eyes were not raised once from the natural timidity felt by a young woman in the presence of royalty
edward half concealed himself behind one of his companions that he might gaze upon her without reserve
but little altered except having grown taller and more rounded and perfect in her figure and her court dress displayed proportions which her humble costume at the new forest had concealed or which time had not matured
there was the same pensive sweet expression in her face which had altered little but the beautiful rounded arms
and the proportion of the whole figure was a surprise to him and edward in his own mind agreed that she might well be the reigning toast of the day mister heatherstone advanced and made his obeisance
and then his daughter was led forward and introduced by a lady unknown to edward after he had saluted her the king said loud enough for edward to hear
i trust that the daughter will often grace our court patience made no reply but passed on and soon afterward edward lost sight of her in the crowd
and time and absence have their effect upon the most ardent of lovers the sight of her so resplendent in beauty acted upon him like magic and he was uneasy till the ceremony was over and he was enabled to go to his sisters
when he entered the room he found himself in the arms of humphrey who had arrived with the messenger after the greetings were over edward said alice and i have seen patience and i fear i must surrender at discretion
mister heatherstone may make his own terms i must wave all pride rather than lose her i thought that i had more control over myself but i have seen her and feel that my future happiness depends upon obtaining her as a wife
let her father but give me her and arnwood will be but a trifle in addition with respect to the conditions upon which you are to possess arnwood said humphrey i can inform you what they are
they are wholly unshackled further than that you are to repay by installments the money expended in the building of the house this i am empowered to state to you and i think you will allow that mister heatherstone
has fully acted up to what he stated were his views when he first obtained a grant of the property he has indeed replied edward as for his daughter edward you have yet to win her and wear her
as the saying is her father will resign the property to you as yours by right but you have no property in his daughter and i suspect that she will not be quite so easily handed over to you
but why should you say so humphrey have we not been attached from our youth yes it was a youthful passion i grant but recollect nothing came of it and years have passed away
it is now seven years since you quitted the forest and in your letters to mister heatherstone you made no remark upon what had passed between you and patience since that you have never corresponded or sent any messages
and you can hardly expect that a girl from the age of seventeen to twenty four will cherish the image of one who to say the least had treated her with indifference that is my view of the matter edward it may be wrong
and it may be true replied edward mournfully well
you know humphrey how many offers patience heatherstone has had and has every day i may say
to a proud brother of mine who does not deserve her it may be so edith replied humphrey women are riddles i only argued upon the common sense of the thing much you know about women
replied edith to be sure you do not meet many in the new forest where you have lived all your life very true my dear sister perhaps that is the reason that the new forest has had such charms for me
after that speech sir the sooner you get back again the better retorted edith but edward made a sign to humphrey and they beat a retreat have you seen the intendant humphrey no
i was about to call upon him but i wanted to see you first i will go with you i have not done him justice replied edward and yet i hardly know how to explain to him say nothing but meet him cordially
that will be explanation sufficient i shall meet him as one whom i shall always revere
what must he think of my not having called upon him nothing you hold a place at court you may not have known that he was in london as you have never met him your coming with me will make it appear so
tell him that i have just made known to you his noble and disinterested conduct you are right i will i fear however humphrey that you are right and edith wrong as regards his daughter
nay edward recollect that i have as edith observed passed my life in the woods edward was most kindly received by mister heatherstone edward
on mister heatherstone repeating to him his intentions relative to arnwood expressed his sense of that gentleman's conduct simply adding you may think me impetuous sir but i trust you will believe me grateful
patience colored up and trembled when edward first saw her edward did not refer to the past for some time after they had renewed their acquaintance he wooed her again and won her
then all was explained about a year after the restoration there was a fete at hampton court given in honor of three marriages taking place edward beverley to patience heatherstone chaloner
to alice and grenville to edith and as his majesty himself said as he gave away the brides could loyalty be better rewarded but our young readers will not be content if they do not hear
some particulars about the other personages who have appeared in our little history humphrey must take the first place his love of farming continued edward gave him a large farm rent free
and in a few years humphrey saved up sufficient to purchase a property for himself he then married clara ratcliffe who has not appeared lately on the scene owing to her having been about two years before the restoration
claimed by an elderly relation who lived in the country and whose infirm state of health did not permit him to quit the house he left his property to clara about a year after her marriage to humphrey
the cottage in the new forest was held by and eventually made over to pablo who became a very steady character and in the course of time married a young girl from arnwood and had a houseful of young gipsies
oswald so soon as edward came down to arnwood gave up his place in the new forest and lived entirely with edward as his steward and phoebe also went to arnwood and lived to a good old age
in the capacity of housekeeper her temper becoming rather worse than better as she advanced in years this is all that we have been able to collect relative to the several parties
psychotherapy and the community both the physician and the patient find their place in the community the life interests of which are superior to the interests of the individual
it is an unavoidable question how far from the higher point of view of the social mind the psychotherapeutic efforts should be encouraged or suppressed are there any conditions which suggest suspicion of or direct opposition to such curative work
of course society has to be sure that no possible misuse and damage are to result from such practice fears in that direction have been uttered repeatedly but from very different standpoints
one which is perhaps most often heard in popular circles results from an entire misunderstanding and deserves hardly any discussion after our detailed study of the processes involved it is claimed that suggestive power especially in the form of
hypnotization may be secretly misused to make anyone without his knowledge and against his will a passive instrument of the hypnotist's intent often this is coupled with telepathic fancies
the hypnotist is believed to have mystic power to bring any person in a distant region under his mental control and thus to be able to carry out any sinister plans by the help of his innocent victim all hypnotizing therefore ought to be interdicted by the state
the presuppositions of such a view are as we know now entirely absurd we know that hypnotism is not based on any special power of the hypnotizer there is no magnetic fluid in the sense of the old mesmerism
the imagination of the hypnotized person is the only hypnotizing agency thus no one can be hypnotized without his knowledge or against his will the story of telepathic mysteries which is often brought before the public
is probably always the outcome of a diseased brain it is indeed a frequent symptom in paranoia and other insanities that the patient who feels abnormal organic sensations and abnormal unaccountable impulses interprets them as influences of a distant enemy
whole pamphlets have been written with elaboration of such insane misinterpretations and requests to legislatures have been made in that spirit but the physician recognizes easily throughout the whole argumentation the well known phenomena of the mental disease
to be sure while no one can be hypnotized against his will many a person is liable to accept suggestions from others and thus to carry out the wishes of others almost without knowing and certainly without willing that the other mind interfere with the interplay of the own motives
but if we were to strike out all suggestive influences from social life we should give up social life itself suggestion is given wherever men come in contact in itself it is neither good nor bad the good resolution and the bad one can be suggested
the good example and the bad can be effective both encouragement of the noble and imitation of the evil may work with the same mental technique certainly there are some persons who have a stronger influence than others on the imagination of those with whom they come in contact
their expression awakens confidence their voice and their words reach deeper layers of the mind their calmness and firmness overwhelm more easily the antagonistic ideas
but the chief difference lies after all in the different degrees of suggestibility among those who receive such impressions the easily suggestible person cannot be protected by any interdict he may catch suggestions everywhere
any advertisement in the newspaper and any display in the shop window may overrun his own intentions what he needs is training in firmness the application of reenforced suggestion or even of hypnotism in the doctor's office is even for him
no possible source of danger on a higher level are objections which come from serious quarters and which are not without sympathy with true science in recent times this opposition has repeatedly found eloquent expression it is an objection from the standpoint of morality
belonging therefore entirely to the purposive view of the mind but we have now reached a point where it is our duty to do justice to this purposive view too as long as we discussed the problem entirely from the standpoint of the physician
no other view of mental life except the causal one could be in question as soon as we look at it from the standpoint of the community it becomes our duty to bring the causal and the purposive view into harmony and it would be narrow and short sighted simply to
draw the practical consequences of a naturalistic view of the mind without inquiring whether or not serious interests in the purposive sphere are injured if there is moral criticism against suggestive therapy it is the duty of the community to consider it
this opposition argues as follows hypnotic influence brings the patient under the will control of the hypnotizer and thus destroys his own freedom whatever the patient may reach in the altered states is reached without his own effort while he is the passive receiver
his achievement has therefore no moral value and if he is really cured of his drunkenness or of his perverse habits of his misuse of cocaine or of his criminal tendencies he has lost the right to be counted a moral agent it would be better
if there were more suffering in the world than that the existence of the moral will should be undermined no one ought to take such arguments lightly the spirit which directs them is needed more than anything else in our time of reaching out for superficial goods
no one can insist too earnestly that life is worth living only if it serves moral duties and moral freedom and is not determined by pleasures and absence of pain only those who set forth this argument are entirely willing to acknowledge the
profound effect which suggestive therapeutics may create more than this they have to acknowledge it to gain a basis for their attack just because the hypnotizer can entirely change the desires and passions the habits and perversities of the suffering victim
he seems to them a moral wrongdoer who negates the principle of human freedom a forcible book of recent days calls the suggestive power of the psychotherapist the great psychological crime it says to the hypnotist
by your own testimony you stand convicted of applying a process which deprives your subjects of the inalienable right and power of individual self control in proportion as you deprive him of the power of self control
you deprive him of that upon which his individual responsibility and moral status depend in proportion as you deprive him of the free control and exercise of those powers of the soul upon which his individual responsibility and moral status depend
you thereby rob him of those powers upon which he must depend for the achievement of individual immortality but this censure too is entirely mistaken not because it urges the purposive views against the causal
but because it is in error as to the facts such critics are fully under the influence of the startling results which are reached they do not take the trouble to examine the long and difficult way which has had to be traversed with patience and energy
it is quite true that if i hypnotize a man and suggest to him to take up after awaking the book which lies on my table he follows my suggestion without conflict and in a certain sense without freedom he feels a simple impulse to go to the table and lift the book and
as no stronger natural desire and no moral objection stand in the way he carries out that meaningless impulse and perhaps even invents a foolish motive to explain to himself why he wanted to look at that book
but after a long experience i have my doubts as to whether a man was ever cured in such a way by hypnotism of serious disturbances and of those anomalous actions which the critics want to see overcome by the patient's own moral efforts on the contrary
every suggestion has to rely on the efforts and struggles of the patient himself and all that the psychotherapists can give him is help in his own moral fight his own will is presupposition for being hypnotized
if again and again i hesitate to undertake new cases it is just because i have to see during the treatment too much of this daily and hourly striving against overpowering impulses the joy of removing some obstacles from the way of the patients
is too much overshadowed by the deep pity and sympathy with their suffering and craving during the whole period of successive treatments to make a man fight where despair is inevitable and where the enemy is necessarily stronger than his own powers can certainly not be the moral demand
morality postulates that everyone find conditions in which he can be victorious if he puts his strongest efforts to the task in our discussion of the mental symptoms i reported as an illustration of the suggestive treatment of the drug passion
the case of a morphinist to make clear this purposive side of the case as against the causal one which alone interested the physician i may add a few features to the short report as a typical example
when that man left my laboratory for the last time to go out to work and happiness you might well have believed from his joyful face that it had been an easy and pleasant time in which hypnotic influence smoothly removed from him the dangerous desire for morphine
in truth it was the result of four months of the most noble and courageous suffering and struggling he had been for years a slave to his passion to quote from his little autobiography when i realized that i was addicted to morphine
that is coming to anyone who is the user of opium or any of its alkaloids for the first few months i found great relief after every injection of morphine but soon i could not get the same easy feeling and could eat but very little and what sleep i got was in the daytime
i finally went to the sanitarium of a doctor
when i first went to see the professor in the harvard psychological laboratory i was using between thirty two and thirty eight grains of morphine daily he put me under his treatment october sixth and that day cut me down by hypnotic treatment to nine grains a day or
three doses of three grains a day i took my hypodermic as directed but on the following day i lay on the bed too exhausted to get up even to get around the room and i could not eat
the desire for the drug was something terrible but in about four days i got used to the loss of so much morphine and stayed on this amount for a week seeing the professor every other day for hypnotic treatment and then returning to my room where i spent twenty two hours of the twenty four on the bed
but did not sleep more than two or three hours a day
i was cut off by hypnotic suggestion half a grain and this put me to fighting the desire again
these reductions of the dose were made a week apart and sometimes only two days the worst time of all was a cut from four injections of a fourth of a grain each to four of one eighth of a grain each which was about january tenth
at this time i had the worst two days of my life i tried whiskey but it gave relief only for about half an hour and then the desire was worse than ever
he was thus at every moment during the day and night in full possession of the deadly poison with which he could have fully satisfied his craving it was a moral victory when he finally reached the point at which he went for several weeks without any desire for morphine
and finally presented the remaining tablets to a hospital and yet there would not have been the least chance for his winning this ethical victory without the outer help of the hypnotist we do not eliminate the moral will but we remove some unfair obstacles from its path
we have no mystic power by which our will simply takes hold of the other man's will but we inhibit and suppress by influence on the imagination those abnormal impulses which resist the sound desires if that were immoral
we should have to make up our minds that all education and training were perverted with such immoral elements every sound respect for authority which makes a child willing to accept the advice and maxims of his elders is just such an influence
if it were really a moral demand that the will be left to its own resources and that no outside influence come to strengthen its power or remove its hindrances or smooth its path then we ought to let the children grow up as nature created them
and ought not to try to suppress from without by discipline and training by love and encouragement the willful impulses and the ugly habits even every good model for imitation is such a suggestive influence from without and every solemn appeal to loyalty and friendship
to patriotism and religion increases the degree of suggestibility that is the glory of life that the suggestive power may belong to moral values instead of mere pleasures but it is not the aim of life to remain untouched by suggestion
and he who by suggestion helps the weak mind to overcome obstacles which the strong mind can overthrow from its inborn resources works for the good of the individual and of the community in the spirit of truest morality much more justified than such
ethical objections are the fears which move entirely in the causal sphere it must be acknowledged that a method which has such powerful influence over the mind that it can secure ideas and emotions and impulses which the own will of the patient cannot produce
ought to be allowed only to those who are prepared for its skillful use to hypnotize or to perform any persistent psychotherapeutic treatment may thus be dangerous if it is done by the unfit
we have discussed before the injuries which might result from the administration of such powerful psychotherapeutic effects through the best meaning minister but we can extend this fear to anyone who has not systematically studied medicine and to a certain degree normal and abnormal psychology
the possibilities of overlooking symptoms which ought to suggest an entirely different treatment or of adjusting the treatment badly to the special physical conditions or of ignoring the desirable physical supplement by drugs or of creating unintentionally by suggestion
injurious effects are always open when medical amateurs undertake such work certainly there is no physician who is not liable to make mistakes and a physician who has never given any attention to psychology and psychiatry
would also be a rather poor agent of psychotherapeutic methods but the probability is that such a physician would simply abstain by principle from all psychotherapeutic methods his mistake only begins if from his lack of acquaintance with the subject
he draws the conclusion that the method itself is undesirable that his real preparation ought to include psychological studies we have pointed out before and the time seems ripe for the community to urge such a reform of the studies
all that involves the conviction that even the experimental psychologist as such is not prepared to enter into medical treatment and a psychological clinic managed by a psychologist who is not a doctor of medicine
is certainly not better than a church clinic i cannot even acknowledge the right of psychologists to make hypnotic experiments merely for the psychological experiment's sake nobody ought to be brought into a hypnotic or otherwise abnormal state of mind
if it is not suggested by the interests of the subject himself science has the right to make hypnotic experiments or experiments with abnormal mental states only under the one condition that a physician has hypnotized the subject in the interests of his health
and that the patient has agreed beforehand to allow in the presence of witnesses certain psychological studies needless to say that any hypnotization for mere amusement and as a parlor trick ought to be considered as
criminal on some other objections which interest the community as such we had to touch before and there is no need of returning to them with any fullness of argument we spoke of the danger which the mental cures carry with them when they are based on any particular creed
what is gained if some nervous disorders are helped by belief if the belief itself devastates our intellectual culture and brings the masses down again to a view of the world which has all the earmarks of barbarism
that is indeed one of the central dangers of all non medical suggestive cures that while any belief may cure through the mere emotional power of the act of believing the content of the belief gains an undeserved appearance of truth
any absurd superstition can become accredited because its curative value may be equal to a truly valuable suggestion the intellectual life of the community would have to suffer greatly if the way to be freed from bodily suffering
had to be the belief in the metaphysical doctrines of missus eddy's science and health from a cultural viewpoint too suggestive therapeutics must stand the higher the more sharply it is separated from special philosophical or religious doctrines
no theory of the world and of god ought to gain authority over the mind from such an external motive as a belief in its curative effects freest from such implications is certainly the hypnotic method of the physician
who does not need the strong religious reenforcement of the suggestion because he reenforces instead the suggestibility of the patient by slight influences on his senses
even where sound religion without superstition and without pseudophilosophy stands behind the therapeutic work the community will not give up the question whether the church does not necessarily neglect by it the interests which are superior
the community becomes more and more strongly aware that too many factors of our modern society urge the church to undertake non religious work social aid and charity work ought to be filled with religious spirit
still more that is true of the healing of the sick whether or not such expansion of church activity in different directions saps the vital strength of religion itself is indeed a problem for the whole community
the fear suggests itself that the spiritual achievement may become hampered that in the competition of the church with the other agencies of social life the particular church task may be pushed to the background and that thus the church
in imitating that which others can do just as well or better loses the power to do that which the church alone can do the final outcome is therefore practically in every way the same from whatever starting point we may come we are led to the conviction
that the physician alone is called to administer psychotherapeutic work but that he needs a thorough psychological training besides his medical one but the interest of the community is not only a negative one
society does not only ask where psychical treatment can be dangerous but asks with not less right whether the scheme and the method might not be fructified for other social ends besides the mere healing of the sick if psychotherapy demonstrates that for instance
hypnotism makes possible the reshaping of a pathological mind it is a natural thought to use the same power for remodeling perhaps the lazy or the intemperate the careless or the inattentive the dishonest or the criminal mind
both educators and criminologists have indeed often raised such questions and social reformers have not seldom seen there wide perspectives for social movements in future times
there can be no doubt that the possibility of such remodeling activity is given but as far as education is concerned certainly grave misgivings ought to be felt when we spoke of the treatment of the sick
we had always to emphasize that the suggestion cures symptoms but not diseases in the same way hypnotic suggestion might reenforce a single trait but would not reform the personality of the child
yes the artificial reenforcement of such special features would deprive education of that which is the most essential namely the development of the power to overcome difficulties by own energy
wherever a reasonable amount of own will force and attention can be expected to overcome the antagonistic influence there artificial hypnotic influence ought to be avoided everything ought to be left in that case to suggestions within normal limits
in the form of good example and persuasions authority and discipline love and sympathy that holds true even for very slight abnormalities which seem still within the limits where the own energies can bring about the cure for instance
i have steadily refused requests of students and others to use hypnotism for the purpose of overcoming merely bad habits such as the habit of biting the nails a child who finds some difficulty in sticking seriously to his tasks might learn now this
and now that under the influence of hypnotic suggestions but he would remain entirely untrained for mastering the next lesson in the same way some naughty traits might be artificially removed but the child would not gain anything towards the much more important power
of suppressing an ugly tendency by his own effort all that finds its limits where the inhibitions or obstacles in the brain of the child are too strong possibly to be overcome by the own good will but in that case
psychotherapy has its right the feeble minded and the retarded child the perverse child and the emotionally unstable child belong under the care of the physician
which are at his disposal still more complex is the criminological problem it sounds like an easy remedy for the greatest social calamity if it is proposed simply to hypnotize the criminal and to supplant his antisocial will by a moral one
and if the absurdity of such a proposal is recognized it seems to many justified to demand such an intrusion at least in the case of the born criminal even if the occasional criminal cannot be reached
but the conception of the born criminal is also only a label which is superficially used for a great variety of minds that men are born with a brain which necessarily produces criminal actions is not indicated by any facts
the varieties which nature really produces are brains which are more liable than others to produce antisocial actions we recognized from the start that the abnormal mind never introduces any new elements but is characterized only by a change of proportions
there is too much or too little of a certain mental process and just for that reason there must be a steady and continuous transition from the normal to the entirely abnormal
chapter thirty four unc billy and old missus possum
all the way home from school peter rabbit did his best to think who it could be who ate flesh yet wasn't a member of the order of flesh eaters
every few hops he would stop to think but all his stopping and all his thinking were in vain and when he started for school the next morning he was as puzzled as ever
on his way through the green forest he passed a certain tree he was just past and no more when a familiar voice hailed him
what's yo hurry peter stopped abruptly and looked up in that tree there peering down at him from a hole high up in the trunk was a sharp whitish gray face
with a pair of twinkling black eyes hello unc billy cried peter how are you and ol missus possum po'ly peter po'ly
we uns haven't had breakfast yet so we uns are feeling po'ly replied unc billy with a grin a sudden thought popped into peter's head
unc poked his head a little farther out and put his hand behind his ear as if he were a little hard of hearing
am i a what he demanded
repeated peter ah reckons ah might be if ah knew what it was but as long as ah don't
mister opossum but peter wasn't listening the fact is peter had started lipperty lipperty lip for school without even being polite enough to say good by he arrived at school quite out of breath
what do you know asked old mother nature
yet doesn't belong to the order of flesh eaters
cried peter right you are replied old mother nature however did you find it out i didn't exactly find it out i guessed it replied peter
on my way here i saw unc billy and it popped into my head right away that he was one we haven't heard about and must be the one but if he eats flesh
i don't see why he isn't a member of the order of flesh eaters it is because he belongs to a group which has something which makes them entirely different from all other animals and for this reason
they have been given an order of their own explained old mother nature they belong to the order of marsupials which means pouched animals
it is because the mothers have big pockets in which they carry their babies old missus possum has just such a pocket
they look too funny for anything the opossums are the only marsupials in this country continued old mother nature
now have i made it quite clear why although they eat flesh unc billy and ol missus possum are not members of the same big order as buster bear and the other flesh eaters everybody nodded
just then chatterer the red squirrel shouted here comes unc billy ol missus possum and all the little possums sure enough down the lone little path
came the possum family and a funny looking sight they were unc billy was whitish gray his face whiter than the rest of him he looked as if he had just gotten out of bed
and forgotten to brush his hair it pointed every which way his legs were dark his feet black and his toes white his ears were without any hair at all
and were black for the lower half the rest being white he had a long whitish tail without any hair on it altogether with his sharp face and naked tail
he looked a great deal as though he might be a giant rat but if unc billy was a funny looking fellow ol missus possum was even more funny looking
she seemed to have heads and tails all over her you see she had brought along her family and ol missus possum is one of those who believe in large families
there were twelve youngsters and they were exactly like their parents only small they were clinging all over ol missus possum some were on her back some were clinging to her sides
and a couple were in the big pocket where they had spent their babyhood we all done thought we'd come to school explained unc billy with a grin
i'm glad you did replied old mother nature you see the rest of your friends here are a little curious about the possum family meanwhile ol missus possum was climbing a tree
and when she had reached a comfortable crotch the little possums left her and began to play about in the tree it was then that it appeared what handy things those naked little tails were
when the little possums crawled out where the branches were small they simply wrapped their tails around the twigs to keep from falling my exclaimed peter
those certainly are handy tails handiest tails ever was declared unc billy
suppose you climb a tree unc billy and show your friends here how you manage to get the eggs from a nest that you cannot reach by crawling along the branch on which it is placed said old mother nature
unc billy grinned and good naturedly started up a tree he crept out on a branch that overhung another branch way out where the branch was small crept unc billy
then he wrapped the end of his tail around the branch and swung himself off keeping hold of the branch only with his tail and one hind foot then
stretching down full length he could just reach the branch below him you see he explained if there was a nest on this branch down here ah could get those eggs without any trouble
again unc billy grinned and then pulled himself back to the other branch old mother nature shook her head reprovingly unc billy said she
you are a bad old rascal to steal eggs what's more
it is a wonder that between you and chatterer the red squirrel any of the birds succeed in raising families around here have you visited farmer brown's hen house lately unc billy shook his head
not lately said he ah done got a dreadful scare the last time ah was up there
where is your home asked johnny chuck i know said peter rabbit it's up in a big hollow tree unc billy looked down at peter
said he are possums found anywhere except around here inquired happy jack yes indeed replied old mother nature they are found all down through the sunny south
and in the warmer parts of the middle west unc billy and his relatives are not fond of cold weather they prefer to be where they can be reasonably warm all the year round some folks think unc billy isn't smart
but those folks don't know unc billy he learned a long time ago that he can't run as fast as some others so he has learned to depend on his wits in time of danger what do you think he does i
know cried peter i saw him do it once farmer brown's boy surprised unc billy and unc billy just fell right over dead pooh that's a story peter rabbit
how could unc billy have fallen over dead and be alive up in that tree this very minute cried happy jack i didn't mean he was really dead but that he looked as if he were dead explained peter
and he did too he was the deadest looking thing i ever saw i thought he was dead myself i was watching from a bramble tangle where i was hiding and i certainly thought
the life had been scared right out of unc billy i guess farmer brown's boy thought so too he picked unc billy up by the tail and looked him all over and said you poor little thing
i didn't mean to hurt you unc billy didn't so much as wink an eye farmer brown's boy went off up the path carrying unc billy by the tail by and by he laid unc billy down
on an old stump while he went to look at a nest of blacky the crow when he came back unc billy wasn't there i never did see unc billy hurry as he did the minute farmer brown's boy's back was turned
he came to life as suddenly as he had dropped dead very good peter said old mother nature some other smart little people try that trick sometimes
but none of them can do it as well as unc billy possum pretending to be dead in order to remain alive is the cleverest thing unc billy does
chapter three the awakening but warming was wrong in that an awakening came what a wonderfully complex thing this simple seeming unity
the self who can trace its reintegration as morning after morning we awaken the flux and confluence of its countless factors interweaving rebuilding the dim first stirrings of the soul
the growth and synthesis of the unconscious to the subconscious the subconscious to dawning consciousness until at last we recognise ourselves again and as it happens to most of us after the night's sleep
so it was with graham at the end of his vast slumber a dim cloud of sensation taking shape a cloudy dreariness and he found himself vaguely somewhere recumbent faint but alive
the pilgrimage towards a personal being seemed to traverse vast gulfs to occupy epochs gigantic dreams that were terrible realities at the time
left vague perplexing memories strange creatures strange scenery as if from another planet there was a distinct impression too of a momentous conversation of a name
he could not tell what name that was subsequently to recur of some queer long forgotten sensation of vein and muscle of a feeling of vast hopeless effort
the effort of a man near drowning in darkness then came a panorama of dazzling unstable confluent scenes graham became aware that his eyes were open
and regarding some unfamiliar thing it was something white the edge of something a frame of wood he moved his head slightly following the contour of this shape
it went up beyond the top of his eyes he tried to think where he might be did it matter seeing he was so wretched
he felt the featureless misery of one who wakes towards the hour of dawn he had an uncertain sense of whispers and footsteps hastily receding
the movement of his head involved a perception of extreme physical weakness he supposed he was in bed in the hotel at the place in the valley but he could not recall that white edge he must have slept
he remembered now that he had wanted to sleep he recalled the cliff and waterfall again and then recollected something about talking to a passer by how long had he slept
what was that sound of pattering feet and that rise and fall like the murmur of breakers on pebbles he put out a languid hand to reach his watch from the chair whereon it was his habit to place it
and touched some smooth hard surface like glass this was so unexpected that it startled him extremely quite suddenly he rolled over stared for a moment and struggled into a sitting position
the effort was unexpectedly difficult and it left him giddy and weak and amazed he rubbed his eyes the riddle of his surroundings was confusing
but his mind was quite clear evidently his sleep had benefited him he was not in a bed at all as he understood the word but lying naked on a very soft and yielding mattress
in a trough of dark glass the mattress was partly transparent a fact he observed with a sense of insecurity and below it was a mirror reflecting him greyly
about his arm and he saw with a shock that his skin was strangely dry and yellow was bound a curious apparatus of rubber bound so cunningly
that it seemed to pass into his skin above and below and this bed was placed in a case of greenish coloured glass as it seemed to him a bar in the white framework of which had first arrested his attention
in the corner of the case was a stand of glittering and delicately made apparatus for the most part quite strange appliances though a maximum and minimum thermometer was recognisable
the slightly greenish tint of the glass like substance which surrounded him on every hand obscured what lay behind but he perceived it was a vast apartment of splendid appearance
and with a very large and simple white archway facing him close to the walls of the cage were articles of furniture a table covered with a silvery cloth silvery like the side of a fish
a couple of graceful chairs and on the table a number of dishes with substances piled on them a bottle and two glasses he realised that he was intensely hungry he could see no one
and after a period of hesitation scrambled off the translucent mattress and tried to stand on the clean white floor of his little apartment he had miscalculated his strength however
and staggered and put his hand against the glass like pane before him to steady himself for a moment it resisted his hand bending outward like a distended bladder then it broke with a slight report
and vanished a pricked bubble he reeled out into the general space of the hall greatly astonished he caught at the table to save himself knocking one of the glasses to the floor
it rang but did not break and sat down in one of the armchairs when he had a little recovered he filled the remaining glass from the bottle and drank a colourless liquid it was but not water
with a pleasing faint aroma and taste and a quality of immediate support and stimulus he put down the vessel and looked about him
the apartment lost none of its size and magnificence now that the greenish transparency that had intervened was removed the archway he saw led to a flight of steps going downward without the intermediation of a door
to a spacious transverse passage this passage ran between polished pillars of some white veined substance of deep ultramarine and along it came the sound of human movements
and voices and a deep undeviating droning note he sat now fully awake listening alertly forgetting the viands in his attention
then with a shock he remembered that he was naked and casting about him for covering saw a long black robe thrown on one of the chairs beside him this he wrapped about him and sat down again trembling
his mind was still a surging perplexity clearly he had slept and had been removed in his sleep but where and who were those people the distant crowd beyond the deep blue pillars
boscastle he poured out and partially drank another glass of the colourless fluid what was this place this place that to his senses seemed subtly quivering like a thing alive
he looked about him at the clean and beautiful form of the apartment unstained by ornament and saw that the roof was broken in one place by a circular shaft full of light
and as he looked a steady sweeping shadow blotted it out and passed and came again and passed beat beat that sweeping shadow had a note of its own in the subdued tumult that filled the air
he would have called out but only a little sound came into his throat then he stood up and with the uncertain steps of a drunkard made his way towards the archway he staggered down the steps
tripped on the corner of the black cloak he had wrapped about himself and saved himself by catching at one of the blue pillars the passage ran down a cool vista of blue and purple
and ended remotely in a railed space like a balcony brightly lit and projecting into a space of haze a space like the interior of some gigantic building beyond and remote
were vast and vague architectural forms the tumult of voices rose now loud and clear and on the balcony and with their backs to him gesticulating and apparently in animated conversation
were three figures richly dressed in loose and easy garments of bright soft colourings the noise of a great multitude of people poured up over the balcony and once it seemed
the top of a banner passed and once some brightly coloured object a pale blue cap or garment thrown up into the air perhaps flashed athwart the space and fell the shouts sounded like english
there was a reiteration of wake he heard some indistinct shrill cry and abruptly these three men began laughing ha ha ha laughed one
a red haired man in a short purple robe when the sleeper wakes when he turned his eyes full of merriment along the passage his face changed the whole man changed
became rigid the other two turned swiftly at his exclamation and stood motionless their faces assumed an expression of consternation an expression that deepened into awe

chapter nine count ferralti
at dinner it was announced that the famous tarantella would be danced in the lower hall of the hotel at nine o'clock and the girls told uncle john that they must not miss this famous sight which is one of the most unique in sorrento or indeed in all italy
as they entered the pretty circular hall devoted to the dance louise gave a start of surprise
a goodly audience had already assembled in the room and among them the girl seemed to recognize an acquaintance for after a brief hesitation she advanced and placed her hand in that of a gentleman who had risen on her entrance and hastened toward her
he was a nice looking young fellow beth thought and had a foreign and quite distinguished air presently louise turned with cheeks somewhat flushed and brought the gentleman to her party
introducing him to uncle john and her cousins as count ferralti whom she had once met in new york while he was on a visit to america
the count twirled his small and slender moustaches in a way that patsy thought affected and said in excellent english
new york adopts a good many said uncle john drily it has even been thoughtless enough to adopt me the dancers entered at that moment and the americans were forced to seat themselves hastily so as not to obstruct the view of others
count ferralti found a place beside louise but seemed to have little to say to her during the course of the entertainment the dances were unique and graceful being executed by a troup of laughing peasants dressed in native costume
who seemed very proud of their accomplishment and anxious to please the throng of tourists present the tarantella originated in ischia but sorrento and capri have the best dancers
afterward uncle john and his nieces stood upon the terrace and watched the volcano rolling its dense clouds mingled with sparks of red hot scoria toward the sky
the count clung to louise's side but also tried to make himself agreeable to her cousins
and beth replied that his manners were so like those of their cousin louise that the two ought to get along nicely together uncle john liked his nieces to make friends and encouraged young men generally to meet them
but there was something in the appearance of this callow italian nobleman that stamped his character as artificial and insincere he resolved to find out something about his antecedents before he permitted the young fellow
to establish friendly relations with his girls next morning after breakfast he wandered through the lobby and paused at the little office where he discovered that the proprietor of this hotel was a brother of that floriano who managed the hotel du vesuve
that gave him an excuse to talk with the man who spoke very good english and was exceedingly courteous to his guests especially when they were american
count ferralti the young man standing by the window yonder i i did not know he said hesitatingly the gentleman arrived last evening and i had not yet learned his name let me see
he turned to his list of guests who register by card and not in a book and continued
he has given his name as ferralti but added no title a count did you say yes replied uncle john the proprietor looked curiously toward the young man whose back only was visible
then he remarked that the eruption of vesuvius was waning and the trouble nearly over for this time
that i cannot tell you signor merrick oh perhaps you know little about the nobility of your country i i know little of the nobility answered floriano indignantly
my dear signor there is no man better posted as to our nobility in all italy yet you say you don't know the ferralti family
observe signor here is our record of nobility it is the same as the blue book or the peerage of england either fortunately or unfortunately i cannot say you have no need of such a book in america
he turned the pages and ran his finger down the line of fs find me if you can a count ferralti in the list uncle john looked he put on his glasses and looked again
and no such noble family signor merrick uncle john whistled softly and walked away to the window the young man greeted him with a smile and a bow i misunderstood your name last evening he said i thought you were count ferralti
and that is right sir was the prompt reply allow me to offer you my card uncle john took the card and read conte leonardi ferralti milano italia
he carefully placed the card in his pocket book thank you said he it's a fine morning count charming mister merrick uncle john walked away he was glad that he had not suspected the young man unjustly
